### **1. Training Language Models to Follow Instructions with Human Feedback**
**By** Long Ouyang, Jeff Wu, Xu Jiang, Diogo Almeida, Carroll L. Wainwright, et al.
**Date** March 4, 2022
#### **Summary**
This paper presents a method for improving language model alignment with human intent through reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). The researchers fine-tune GPT-3 using human-written demonstrations and ranked model outputs to create InstructGPT, which follows user instructions more effectively. InstructGPT models significantly outperform GPT-3 in human preference ratings, achieving better truthfulness and reduced toxicity despite having far fewer parameters. The study underscores the potential of RLHF in improving AI alignment but acknowledges lingering challenges, including biases from human labelers and occasional model failures in instruction-following.
#### **Quotes**
> _"Fine-tuning with human feedback significantly improves the ability of language models to follow instructions, reducing toxicity and hallucination while enhancing truthfulness."_
> _"Even though InstructGPT is 100x smaller than GPT-3, human evaluators still preferred its responses."_

### **3. DeepSeek-R1: Incentivizing Reasoning Capability in LLMs via Reinforcement Learning**
**By** DeepSeek-AI  
**Date** January 22, 2025
#### **Summary**
DeepSeek-R1 explores reinforcement learning (RL) as a method to enhance reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs). The authors develop two models—DeepSeek-R1-Zero, which uses RL without supervised fine-tuning, and DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates cold-start data and multi-stage training. The results show improved performance on benchmarks like MATH-500 and Codeforces, achieving performance comparable to OpenAI's latest models. A key insight is that RL alone can lead to self-emergent reasoning behaviors, challenging the necessity of extensive supervised fine-tuning. The work also highlights distillation strategies for transferring reasoning skills to smaller models.
