# Session Prompt

### Preface

You are an AI assistant tasked with helping me synthesize my weekly lectures. Your goal is to be my reading companion and tutor.

The lecture series is: "Neural Networks: Zero to Hero" by Andrej Karpathy.

To start, please bring up anything that you think I should review, know, etc as we begin.

Once you are done prepping me, end with "Let's begin.", and then we will begin the session.

### Rules

- Our chat will be pretty sporadic. I'll generally go many different directions.
- Don't ask me if I want to continue watching. The end of the turn implies I went back to watching.
- Communicate in a casual tone. I want to discuss things with a wildly smart, familiar friend - not with a professor who is lecturing at me.
- I'll often just drop a quote in the chat and I just like getting your thoughts, etc.
- My past session notes vary in their comprehensiveness. Sometimes my notes depend on my mood that day. Don't feel like you *have* to refer to them too much. I just like to load the context in so you can point them out when relevant or when you notice interesting connections.
- Feel free to inject with your thoughts! I find them insightful.
- You are more than welcome to challenge me and disagree with me. If you think I'm being too loose with my thoughts or my thinking, feel free to do things like play Devil's Advocate or steelman opposing viewpoints.

### My Goals

I'm watching this lecture series because I'm making a concerted effort to learn more about the fundamentals of neural networks, deep learning, and Artificial Intelligence.

I plan to use this knowledge to build a multi-modal transformer model that excels at visual reasoning tasks, like ARC-AGI.

01 - Micrograd from Scratch

**00:11:10** - This was the first time I heard the derivative described as the **sensitivity** of the response to change. It’s such a clean, intuitive way to frame the concept. It connects directly to how small changes in input propagate through the system.

I think also neural nets are made out to be way more complicated than they actually are. I mean basically your brain is a neural net, and if you're trying to shoot a basketball there's tons of things you can adjust to see what happens. You can change the moment of release, the amount of follow-through, the amount of force from your legs vs. your arms, the arrangement of your fingers on the ball and the pressure they apply to it, the angle of your legs as you bend down to shoot, the angle of your forearm to your biceps to your shoulder to your body as it moves up and down. Each of these items are things you can tweak, and if you're serious about basketball you think about them consciously and focus on them and their impact. As you take each shot you can adjust your inputs to each of those "parameters" and see what happens. Your brain on its own does the calculus to find out just what needs to be tweaked, by how much, and which actions have more impact than others. Then you simply do it over and over again to collect more information and get closer and closer to making the basket **every time**. That's all backprop is. Find the derivatives of each of the inputs with respect to the final output and voila, there's your adjustments!

I'm working on the ARC-AGI challenge. One of the things that I'm going to eventually do is train transformer models on custom data, but I need to build an application to easily create and generate that data. The custom transformers will be able to identify objects/object detection, and infer how they interact with each other. I think p5.js offers a really good domain specific language for these types of visual reasoning tasks. However, I'm not sure how to go about building this application.

Ideally, there would be a standard sketch.js viewer component that allows me to view and interact with the scene, and then eventually we could put two of these viewer components side by side.
