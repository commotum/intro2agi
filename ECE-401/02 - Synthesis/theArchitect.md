Based on the discussion in the notes, particularly Chollet's insights, here's how I would approach building "the machine that builds the machine" for ARC-like visual reasoning tasks:

1. **Core Architecture**
```python
class MetaLearningSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.knowledge_base = {
            'building_blocks': [],  # Reusable functions/patterns
            'abstractions': [],     # Higher-level concepts
            'models': []            # Task-specific models
        }
        
    def solve_novel_task(self, task):
        # 1. Model the task
        task_model = self.create_task_model(task)
        
        # 2. Search for solution using multiple approaches
        solution = self.hierarchical_search(task_model)
        
        # 3. Learn from experience
        self.update_knowledge_base(task, solution)
        
        return solution

    def create_task_model(self, task):
        """
        Create a descriptive model of what we see:
        - Objects and their properties
        - Relationships between objects
        - Causal relationships
        """
        pass

    def hierarchical_search(self, task_model):
        """
        1. Try induction first (program synthesis)
        2. Fall back to transduction if needed
        3. Use LLMs to guide the search process, not generate code directly
        """
        pass

    def update_knowledge_base(self, task, solution):
        """
        1. Identify reusable patterns
        2. Abstract into higher-level building blocks
        3. Store for future use
        """
        pass
```

2. **Key Design Principles**:

- Don't treat program synthesis as token-by-token generation
- Represent programs as graphs of operators
- Use LLMs to guide search, not generate code
- Combine symbolic and neural approaches
- Learn and store reusable abstractions
- Support both induction and transduction
- Enable verification of solutions

3. **Implementation Strategy**:

a) Start with a basic system that can:
- Parse visual scenes into objects/relationships
- Generate simple programs using basic building blocks
- Verify solutions through testing

b) Add meta-learning capabilities:
- Pattern recognition across solutions
- Abstraction of common patterns
- Storage and retrieval of useful building blocks

c) Integrate advanced features:
- LLM-guided search
- Program graph manipulation
- Hybrid symbolic/neural representations

The key insight from Chollet is that we shouldn't just generate programs directly, but rather build a system that can:
1. Model what it sees
2. Search efficiently through solution space
3. Learn and reuse patterns
4. Verify its own solutions

This is different from current approaches that either:
- Try to generate programs token-by-token
- Use pure pattern matching/transduction
- Rely on fixed DSLs without learning new abstractions

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these aspects?




Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)
Tokenizes text by merging the most frequent adjacent pairs of tokens (initially characters) into new tokens until a fixed vocabulary size is reached. 

example:  
starting with "unbelievable":
1. tokens: `u`, `n`, `b`, `e`, `l`, `i`, `e`, `v`, `a`, `b`, `l`, `e`.
2. frequent pairs: `un`, `be`, `li`, `ev`, `ab`, `le`.
3. merge: `un`, `bel`, `iev`, `able`.
result: `un`, `believ`, `able`.

frequent patterns become single tokens; rare words are split into subwords for flexibility.


Needs to be able to dynamically expand and explore the hierarchical levels and structure.
For example, if the AI could use a programmable decoder so that it doesn't need to know all of the construction.

Like let's say we use the full word "unbelievable" as a token, but maybe the AI wants to explore those subtokens to get more detail and information. If there's a performant program that can expound the concepts on demand, and not always be necessary that would be great.
