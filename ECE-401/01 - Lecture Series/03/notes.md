Early attempts at language modeling failed because words were treated as unrelated, individual units, failing to capture the patterns within patterns that humans intuitively learn from an early age. For example, cats and dogs are both animals, you can read the newspaper or a book, and if you need to get from New York to Los Angeles, trains, planes and automobiles are all much faster than walking or running.

"The feature vectors associated with each word are learned, but they could be initialized using prior knowledge of semantic features."

Get the index of the word to look up from the lookup table 

---

### Step-by-Step Process

#### Thing 1: **Input Sequence**
- **Description**: A sequence of three previous words used to predict the fourth word.
- **Label**: $ W_{\text{prev}} = \{w_1, w_2, w_3\} $
- **Details**: These are the specific words in a sequence, e.g., "the cat runs" where $w_1 = "the"$, $w_2 = "cat"$, $w_3 = "runs"$, and we want to predict $w_4$.

#### Step 1: **Define Vocabulary**
- **Action**: Establish the total set of possible words that can appear in the sequence.
- **Thing**: **Vocabulary**
  - **Label**: $ V $
  - **Details**: A set of 17,000 unique words, as mentioned (e.g., $ V = \{ \text{"the"}, \text{"cat"}, \text{"runs"}, \ldots \} $, size $ |V| = 17,000 $).

#### Step 2: **Assign Indices to Words**
- **Action**: Convert each word in the Input Sequence into a numerical index based on its position in the Vocabulary.
- **Thing**: **Word Indices**
  - **Label**: $ I = \{i_1, i_2, i_3\} $
  - **Details**: Each $ i_k $ (where $ k = 1, 2, 3 $) is an integer between 0 and 16,999, representing the index of $ w_k $ in $ V $. For example, if "the" is the 5th word in $ V $, then $ i_1 = 4 $ (assuming 0-based indexing, as implied by "0 to 16,999").
  - **Process**: Look up each word $ w_1, w_2, w_3 $ in $ V $ and assign its corresponding integer index.

#### Thing 2: **Embedding Matrix**
- **Description**: A lookup table that maps each word index to a dense vector representation.
- **Label**: $ C $
- **Details**: A matrix with dimensions $ 17,000 \times 30 $, where:
  - Rows = 17,000 (one for each word in $ V $).
  - Columns = 30 (each word gets a 30-dimensional vector).
  - Each row is an **Embedding Vector** for a specific word.

#### Step 3: **Convert Indices to Embeddings**
- **Action**: Use the Word Indices to extract rows from the Embedding Matrix, converting each index into a 30-dimensional vector.
- **Thing**: **Embedding Vectors**
  - **Label**: $ E = \{e_1, e_2, e_3\} $
  - **Details**: For each $ i_k $ in $ I $:
    - $ e_k = C[i_k] $, where $ C[i_k] $ is the row of $ C $ at index $ i_k $.
    - $ e_k $ is a 30-dimensional vector (e.g., $ e_1 = [0.2, -0.1, \ldots] $ for "the").
  - **Process**: For $ i_1, i_2, i_3 $, pluck out the corresponding rows from $ C $. So, $ E $ contains three vectors, each 30D.
  - **Note**: $ C $ is **shared** across all words—same matrix used for all lookups.

#### Thing 3: **Input Layer**
- **Description**: The combined representation of the three words fed into the neural network.
- **Label**: $ X $
- **Details**: Concatenation of the Embedding Vectors $ E $.
  - Each $ e_k $ has 30 dimensions, so for 3 words: $ 30 \times 3 = 90 $ neurons total.
  - $ X = [e_1, e_2, e_3] $, a 90-dimensional vector (e.g., if $ e_1 = [0.2, -0.1, \ldots] $, $ e_2 = [0.5, 0.3, \ldots] $, etc., $ X $ stacks them).

#### Step 4: **Form Input Layer**
- **Action**: Combine the Embedding Vectors into a single input vector for the neural network.
- **Process**: Take $ e_1, e_2, e_3 $ and concatenate them into $ X $, a 90D vector.
  - Example: If $ e_1 = [0.2, -0.1, \ldots] $ (30 numbers), $ e_2 = [0.5, 0.3, \ldots] $, $ e_3 = [0.1, 0.4, \ldots] $, then $ X = [0.2, -0.1, \ldots, 0.5, 0.3, \ldots, 0.1, 0.4, \ldots] $ (90 numbers).

#### Thing 4: **Hidden Layer**
- **Description**: A layer in the neural network that processes the Input Layer to capture patterns.
- **Label**: $ H $
- **Details**: A set of neurons with a size chosen by the designer, called a **Hyperparameter**.
  - **Hyperparameter**: **Hidden Layer Size** ($ S_H $).
  - Example: $ S_H = 100 $ neurons, but it’s adjustable (could be 50, 200, etc.).

#### Step 5: **Define Hidden Layer**
- **Action**: Set the size of the Hidden Layer as a design choice and prepare to process the Input Layer through it.
- **Process**: 
  - Choose $ S_H $ (e.g., 100).
  - $ H $ will take $ X $ (90D) as input and transform it into a vector of size $ S_H $ (e.g., 100D).
  - This involves weights and biases (not detailed here), but the size $ S_H $ is the key focus.

#### Step 6: **Evaluate Hidden Layer Size**
- **Action**: Test different sizes of the Hidden Layer to see how well the neural network performs.
- **Thing**: **Performance Metric**
  - **Label**: $ M $
  - **Details**: Some measure of success (e.g., accuracy in predicting the fourth word).
- **Process**: 
  - Try multiple $ S_H $ values (e.g., 50, 100, 200).
  - Train the network with $ X $ feeding into $ H $, then predict the fourth word.
  - Assess $ M $ for each $ S_H $ to find the best size.

### How It Fits Together
- Start with three words ($ W_{\text{prev}} $).
- Map them to indices ($ I $) using a 17,000-word vocab ($ V $).
- Look up 30D embeddings ($ E $) in $ C $.
- Stack them into a 90D input ($ X $).
- Feed $ X $ to a hidden layer ($ H $) of size $ S_H $.
- Tune $ S_H $ by checking performance ($ M $) to predict the fourth word.

This is a classic word embedding + neural network setup for language modeling, like an early version of something like Word2Vec or a simple feedforward net. Does this breakdown work for you? Want me to expand any step or clarify a "thing"?

Let me explain the concept of embeddings that Andrej Karpathy is discussing around the 17-minute mark.

An embedding is essentially a way to convert discrete items (like characters or words) into continuous vectors of numbers that can be used by neural networks. Here's a breakdown:

1. **The Problem**:
- Neural networks can't directly work with characters/words
- They need numbers as input
- Simply using integer IDs (like 0-26 for alphabet) doesn't capture any meaningful relationships between characters

2. **The Solution (Embeddings)**:
- Each character gets converted into a small vector of numbers (like 2 numbers in his initial example)
- These vectors are learned during training
- Similar characters end up getting similar vector representations

3. **Visual Example**:
Later in the video (~1:05:45), he shows a visualization of the 2D embeddings where:
- Vowels (a,e,i,o,u) cluster together because they serve similar functions
- The letter 'q' is far from others because it behaves uniquely
- The dot (.) is isolated because it's a special character

4. **Real World Analogy**:
Imagine you're trying to describe fruits to an alien using only numbers:
```
Apple  -> [0.7, 0.3]
Pear   -> [0.8, 0.4]   // Similar to apple
Orange -> [0.2, 0.8]    // Different from apple/pear
```
The numbers capture relationships - apples and pears get similar numbers because they're similar fruits.

5. **Technical Implementation**:
```python
# If embedding_dim = 2
embeddings = torch.randn(27, 2)  # 27 characters, 2 numbers per character

# Converting character 'a' (index 1) to its embedding
a_embedding = embeddings[1]  # Gets the 2 numbers representing 'a'
```

The key insight is that these embeddings aren't hand-designed - they're learned by the neural network during training to be useful for the task at hand. Characters that function similarly in names will end up with similar embedding vectors.


Let me explain the key differences between embeddings, one-hot encoding, and simple indexing:

1. **Simple Indexing (0, 1, 2, ...):**
````python
# Simple indexing for alphabet
a = 0
b = 1
c = 2
````
Problem: There's no meaningful relationship between these numbers. Is 'a' more similar to 'b' than to 'z'? The numbers don't tell us.

2. **One-Hot Encoding:**
````python
# One-hot encoding for 'a', 'b', 'c' in a 26-letter alphabet
a = [1,0,0,0,0,...,0]  # 26 dimensions
b = [0,1,0,0,0,...,0]  # 26 dimensions
c = [0,0,1,0,0,...,0]  # 26 dimensions
````
Problem: All vectors are equally different from each other. No relationships are captured. Also very sparse and high-dimensional.

3. **Embeddings:**
````python
# Learned embeddings (example values)
a = [0.2, 0.8]    # 2 dimensions
e = [0.3, 0.7]    # similar to 'a' because both are vowels
q = [-0.9, -0.5]  # very different because 'q' behaves uniquely
````

Key differences:
- **Dimensionality**: Embeddings can be much more compact (e.g., 2 numbers instead of 26)
- **Learned Relationships**: The values are learned during training to capture meaningful patterns
- **Continuous Space**: Similar items can have similar vectors, unlike one-hot where everything is equally different
- **Dense Information**: Each number in the embedding vector carries meaning, unlike the sparse one-hot encoding

Think of it like this:
- Simple indexing is like numbering houses on a street: #1, #2, #3
- One-hot encoding is like giving each house its own unique street
- Embeddings are like giving each house GPS coordinates - houses that are close together in function get similar coordinates

The values in embeddings aren't biases - they're learned representations that capture the relationships between items in a way that's useful for the neural network's task.

Not exactly! Let me clarify the difference:

1. A 30-bit word would be like this:
```python
# 30-bit word (only 0s and 1s)
'dog' -> [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, ..., 1]  # only binary values
```

2. An embedding vector (30 dimensions) is like this:
```python
# 30-dimensional embedding (floating point numbers)
'dog' -> [0.234, -1.645, 0.772, 0.013, -0.442, ..., 0.891]  # any real number
```

Key differences:
- Bits can only be 0 or 1
- Embedding dimensions can be any real number (like 0.234 or -1.645)
- Bits are fixed, while embedding values are learned during training
- With 30 bits, you can only represent 2³⁰ different patterns
- With 30-dimensional embeddings, you can represent infinite variations because each dimension is a continuous value

The embedding approach gives much more expressive power to capture subtle relationships between words, because:
1. Words can be "slightly similar" (their vectors are close but not identical)
2. The network can learn to position words in this continuous space during training
3. The distances and directions between word vectors can capture meaningful relationships

Think of it more like coordinates in a 30-dimensional space rather than a binary code!



Almost! You're on the right track, but there's a small but important correction needed. In the makemore context (and Karpathy's video), we're actually:

1. Starting with random positions for each CHARACTER (not word) in n-dimensional space
2. Using these positions to try to PREDICT THE NEXT CHARACTER in names
3. The network isn't looking for the "next closest" character, but rather learns to transform these embedding positions into probabilities for what character should come next

Here's a simplified example:
`````python
# 1. Start with random embeddings for each character
embeddings = {
    'a': [0.2, -0.5],  # random 2D position
    'b': [-0.8, 0.3],
    'r': [0.4, 0.1],
    # ... for all characters
}

# 2. For a name like "sara":
# - Look up 's' embedding
# - Use it to predict that 'a' often comes after 's'
# - Look up 'a' embedding
# - Use it to predict that 'r' often comes after 'a'
# - and so on...

# 3. During training, if we see "sara" a lot:
# - Characters that often appear in similar contexts (like vowels)
#   will gradually move closer together in the embedding space
# - But it's not directly because we want them close,
#   it's because that helps the network make better predictions
`````

The key difference from your description is:
- We're not directly using "closest" positions to make predictions
- Instead, the network learns both:
  1. Good embedding positions for characters
  2. How to transform these positions into accurate predictions
- Characters end up close to each other as a side effect of being used in similar ways, not because we're explicitly trying to make them close

The embeddings become meaningful because characters that serve similar functions in names (like vowels) need similar representations to help the network make accurate predictions about what comes next.



Let’s pretend you have a huge dictionary with about 291,500 different words. If you try to build a simple table that stores the probability of every possible 10‑word combination from that dictionary, you’d need one “parameter” (a single number) for each combination. That’s 291,500^10 different possibilities—a number so big it’s roughly 10^55 (a 1 with 55 zeros).

When we talk about “parameters” in a model, we mean the knobs the model can adjust to learn from data. If you had to keep a separate knob for every single 10‑word combination, you’d need 10^55 knobs! This is obviously unmanageably huge—way bigger than the entire 20‑volume Oxford English Dictionary (which only has about 291,500 entries, not 10^55).

That’s why language modeling is hard if you try to store everything in a giant table. Models like neural networks instead learn patterns (like “cat” and “dog” being semantically related) so they don’t have to memorize every possible combination—this lets them get away with a far smaller (but still large) number of parameters.
