PREFACE.
[I.] The volume now offered to the public is designed as an assis-
tance to those persons who may be disposed to study and to em
ploy a certain new mathematical method, which has, for some
years past, occupied much of my own attention, and for which I
have ventured to propose the name of the Method or Calculus of
Quaternions. Although a copious analytical index, under the
form of a Table of Contents, will be found to have been prefixed
to the work, yet it seems proper to offer here some general and
preliminary* remarks: especially as regards that conception from
which the whole has been gradually evolved, and the motives for
giving to the resulting method an appellation not previously in
use.
[2.] The difficulties which so many have felt in the doctrine
of Negative and Imaginary Quantities in Algebra forced them-
selves long ago on my attention ; and although 1 early formed
some acquaintance with various views or suggestions that had
been proposed by eminent writers, for the purpose of removing
• Some readers may find it convenient to pass over for the present these pre-
fatory remarks, and to proceed at once to the Volume, of which a large part has
been drawn up so as to suppose less of previous and technical preparation than
some of the paragraphs of this Preface. Indeed, great pains have been taken
to render the early Lectures as elementary as the subject would allow ; and it
is hoped that they will be found perfectly and even easily intelligible by persons
of moderate scientific attainments. It is true that some of the subsequent por-
tions of the Course (especially parts of the concluding Lecture) may possibly
appear difficult, from the novel nature of the calculations employed: but perhaps
on that very account those later portions may repay the attention of more ad-
vanced mathematical students.

or eluding those difficulties (such as the theory of direct and in-
verse quantities, and of indirectly correlative figures, the method
of constructing imaginaries by lines drawn from one point with
various directions in one plane, and the view which refers all to
the mere play of algebraical operations, and to the properties of
symbolical language), yet the whole subject still appeared to me
to deserve additional inquiry, and to be susceptible of a more
complete elucidation. And while agreeing with those who had
contended that negatives and imaginaries were not properly
quantities at all, I still felt dissatisfied with any view which
should not give to them, from the outset, a clear interpretation
and meaning; and wished that this should be done, for the square
roots ofnegatives, without introducing considerations so expressly
geometrical, as those which involve the conception of an angle.
[3.] It early appeared to me that these ends might be at-
tained by our consenting to regard Algebraas being no mere
Art, nor Language, nor primarily a Science of Quantity; but
rather as the Science of Order in Progression. It was, how-
ever, a part of this conception, that the progression here spoken
ef was understood to be continuous and unidimensional: extend-
ing indefinitelyy(>rj^;ard and backward, but not in any lateral
direction. Andalthough the successive states of such a progres-
sion might (no doubt) be represented by points upon a line, yet
I thought that their simple successiveness was better conceived
by comparing them with moments oftime, divested, however, of
all reference to cause and effect; so that the *' time" here consi-
dered might be said to be abstract, ideal, ovpure, like that "space"
which is the object ofgeometry. In this manner I was led, many
years ago, to regard Algebra as the Science of Pure Time:
and an Essay,* containing my views respecting it as such, was
publishedf in 1835. IfI now reproduce a few of the opinions put

f I was encouraged to entertain and publish this view, by remembering some
passages in Kant's Criticism of the Pure Reason, which appeared to justify the
expectation that it should be possible to construct, d priori, a Science of Time,

forward in that early Essay, it will be simply because they may
assist the reader to place himself in that point ofview, as regards
the first elements of algebra^ from which a passage was gradually
made by me to that comparatively geometrical conception which
it is the aim of this volume to unfold. And with respect to any-
thing unusual in the interpretations thus proposed, for some sim-
ple and elementary notations, it is my wish to be understood as
not at all insisting on them as necessary * but merely proposing
them as consistent among themselves, and preparatory to the
study of the quaternions, in at least one aspect of the latter.
[4.] In the view thus recently referred to, if the letters a and
B were employed as dates, to denote any two moments of time,
which might or might not be distinct, the case ofthe coincidence or
identity of these two moments, or of equivalence of these two
dates, was denoted by the equation,
B= a;
which symbolic assertion was thus interpreted as not involving
any original reference to quantity, nor as expressing the result
as well as a Science of Space. For example, in his Transcendental iEsthetic,
Kant observes :—" Zeit und Raum sind demnach zwey Erkenntnissquellen, aus
denen « ^jreore verschiedene synthetische Erkenntnisse geschdpft werden kbnnen,
wie vornehmlich die rcinc Mathematik in Ansehung der Erkenntnisse vom Raume
und dessen Verlialtnissen ein gliinzendes Beyspiel gibt. Sie sind namlich beide
zusaniraengenommen reine Formen aller sinnlichen Anschauung, und machen
dadurch synthetische Satze a priori mogiich." Which may be rudely rendered
thus:—"Time and Space are therefore two knowledge-sources, from which
different synthetic knowledges can be a priori derived, as eminently in reference
to the knowledge of space and of its relations a brilliant example is given by the
pure mathematics. For they are, both together [space and time], pure forms of
all sensuous intuition, and make thereby synthetic positions a priori possible."
(Critik der reinen Vernunft, p. 41. Seventh Edition. Leipzig: 1828).
•For example, the usual identity (b-a)-|-a=b, which in the older Essay
was interpreted with reference to tiniQ, as in paragraph [8] of this Preface, the
letters a and B denoting moments, is in the present work (Lecture I., article 25)
interpreted, on an analogous plan indeed, but with a reference to space, the let-
ters denoting/joints. Still it will be perceived that there exists a close connexion
between the two views ; a step, in each, being conceived to be applied to a state
ofa progression, so as to generate (or conduct to) another state. And generally
I think that it may be found useful to compare the interpretations of which a
sketch is given in the present Preface, with those proposed in the body of the
work.

of any comparison between two durations as measured. It cor-
responded to the conception of simultaneity or synchronism; or,
in simpler words,it represented the thought ofthe present in time.
Of all possible answers to the general question, *^fVhen," the
simplest is the answer,
" Now:" and it was the attitude ofmind,
assumed in the making of this answer, which (in the system here
described) might be said to be originally symbolized by the
equation above written. And, in like manner, the two formulae
of no/j-equivalence,
B > A, B < A,
were interpreted, without any primary reference to quantity, as
denoting the two contrasted relations oi subsequence and oipre-
cedence, which answer to the thoughts oiihefuture and the past
in time; or .is expressing, simply, the one that the moment b is
conceived to be later than a, and the other that b is earlier than
a: without yet introducing even the conception of a measure, to
determine how much later, or how much earlier, one moment is
than the other.
[5.] Such having been proposed as XhQfirst meanings to be
assigned to the three elementary marks= > < , it was next sug-
gested that i\iefrst use of the mark -, in constructing a science
ofpure time, might be conceived to be the forming of a complex
symbol n- a, to denote the difference between two moments, or
the ordinal relation of the moment b to the moment a, whether
that relation were one of identity or of diversity ; and if the lat-
ter, then whether it were one of subsequence or of precedence,
and in whatever degree. And here, no doubt, in attending to
the degree of such diversity between two moments, the concep-
tion of duration, as quantity in time, was introduced: the full
meaning of the symbol b -a, in any particular application, being
(on this plan) not known, until we know how long after, or how
long before, if at all, b is than a. But it is evident that the no-
tion of a certain quality (or kind) of this diversity, or interval,
enters into this conception of a difference between moments, at
least as fully and as soon as the notion oi quantity, amount, or
duration. The contrast between the Future and the Past appears
to be even earlier and more fundamental, in human thought, than
that between the Great and the Little.
PREFACE. /_s
[6.] After comparing moments^ it was easy to proceed to
compare relations; and in this view, by an extension ofthe recent
signification [4] of the sign=
, it was used to denote analogy in
time ; or, more precisely, to express the equivalence oftwo marks
ofone common ordinal relation, between two pairs of moments.
Thus the formula,
D- c =B-A,
came to be interpreted as denoting an equality between two
intervals in time ; or to express that the moment d is related
to the moment c, exactly as b is to a, with respect to identity
or diversity: the quantity and quality of such diversity (when
it exists) being here both taken into account. A formula of
this sort was shewn to admit of inversion and alternation
(c-D= A-B, d-b= c-a); and generally there could be per-
formed a number of transformations and combinations of equa-
tions such as these, which all admitted of being interpreted and
justified by this mode of viewing the subject, but which agreed
in all respects with the received rules of algebra. On the same
plan, the two contrasted formulae of inequalities of differences,
D-OB-A, D-C<B-A,
were interpreted as signifying, the one that d was later, relatively
to c, than b to a; and the other that d was relatively earlier.
[7.] Proceeding to the mark +, 1 used this sign primarily as
a mark of combination between a symbol, such as the smaller
Roman letter a, of a step in time, and the symbol, such as a, of
the moment/row which this step was conceived to be made, in
order to form a complex symbol, a + a, recording this conception
oftransition, and denoting the moment (suppose b) to which the
step was supposed to conduct. The step or transition here
spoken ofwas regarded as a mental act, which might as easily be
supposed to conAxxci backwards asforwards in the progression of
time; or even to be a null step, denoted by 0, and producing no
effect (0 + a = a). Thus, with these meanings of the signs, the
notation
B = a+ A,
denoted the conception that the moment b might be attained, or

mentally generated^ by making (in thought) the step a from the
moment a. And it appeared to me that without ceasing to re-
gard the symbol b- a as denoting, in one view [5], an ordinal
relation between two moments, we might also use it in the con-
nected sense of denoting this stepfrom one to another: which
would allow us (as in ordinary algebra) to write, with the recent
suppositions,
B-A= a;
the two members of this new equation being here symbols for
one common step.
[8.] The usual identity,
(b- a) + A = B,
came thus to be interpreted as signifying primarily (in the
Science ofPure Time) a certain conceived connexion between the
operations, of rfe^erwjwiw^ the difference between two moments
as a relation, and of applying that difference as a step. And the
two Other familiar and connected identities,
c- A = (c- b) + (b- a), c- b= (c- a)- (b- a),
were treated, on the same plan, as originally signifying certain
compositions and decompositions of ordinal relations or of steps
in time. A special symbol for opposition between any two such
relations or steps was proposed; but it was remarked that the
more usual notations, + a and - a, for the step (a) itself, and for
the opposite of that step, might, in full consistency with the same
general view, be employed, if treated as abridgments for the more
complex symbols + a,- a: the latter notation presenting here
no difficulty of interpretation, nor requiring any attempt to con-
ceive the subtraction of a quantity from nothing, but merely the
decomposilion ofa null step into two opposite steps. But opera-
tions on steps, conducted on this plan, were shewn to agree in
all respects with the usual rules of algebra, as regarded Addition
and Subtraction.
[9.] One time-step (b) was next compared with another (a),
in the way of algebraic ratio, so as to conduct to the conception
of a certain complex relatioti (or quotient), determined partly by
their relative largeness, but partly also by their relative direction,
;

as similar or opposite; and to the closely connected conception of
an algebraic number (or multiplier)^ which operates at once on
the quantity and on the direction of the one step (a), so as to
produce (or mentally generate) the quantity and direction of the
other step (b). By a combination of these two conceptions, the
usual identity,
— X a =b, or b = a X a, if- = a,
a a
received an interpretation; the factor a being a positive or a con-
tra-positive (more commonly called negative) number^ according
as it preserved or reversed the direction of the step on which it
operated. The four primary operations, for combining any two
such ratios or numbers or factors, a and b, among themselves,
were defined by four equations which may be written thus, and
which were indeed selected from the usual formulae of algebra,
but were employed with new interpretations
(6 + a) X a = (6 X a) + (a X a) ; (i X fl) X a=6 X (a X a)
(6- a) x a = (i x a)- (a x a)
^
6 -^ a = (6 x a)
(a x a).
[10.] Operations on algebraic numbers (positive or contra-
positive) were thus made to depend (in thought) on operations
of the same names on steps; which were again conceived to in-
volve, in their ultimate analysis, a reference ,to comparison of
moments. These conceptions were found to conduct to results
agreeing with those usually received in algebra; at least when
was treated as a symbol of a null number^ as well as of a null step
[7], and when the symbols, + a, 0-a, were abridged to + a
and- a. In this view, there was no difficulty whatever, in in-
terpreting the product of two negative numbers^ as being equal
to ?i positive number : the result expressing simply, in this view
of it, that two successive reversals restore the direction of a step.
And other difficulties respecting the rule ofthe signs appeared
in like manner to fall away, more perfectly than had seemed to
me to take place in any view of algebra, which made the thought
of quantity (or of magnitude) the primary or fundamental con-
ception.
[11.] This theory of algebraic numbers, as ratios of steps in
time, was applied so as to include results respecting powers and
(8) PREFACE.
roots and logarithms: but what it is at present chiefly important
to observe is, that because, for the reason just assigned, the
square oi every number is positive, therefore no number, whether
positive or negative, could be a square root ofa negative num-
ber, in this any more than in other views of algebra. At least
it was certain that no single number, of the kinds above con-
sidered, could possibly be such a root: but I thought that with-
out going out of the same general class of interpretations, and
especially without ceasing to refer all to the notion of time, ex-
plained and guarded as above, we might conceive and compare
couples of moments; and so derive a conception oi couples of
steps (in time), on which might be founded a theory of couples
ofnumbers, wherein no such difficulty should present itself.
[12.] In this extended view, the symbols Ai and A2 being
employed to denote the two moments of one such pair or couple,
and Bi, B2 the two moments of another pair, I was led to write
the formula,
(Bi, B2)- (Ai, A2)= (Bi- Ai, B2- A2) ;
and to explain it as expressing that the complex ordinal relation
of one moment-couple (bi, B2) to another moment-couple (a,, Aj)
might be regarded as a relation-couple ; that is to say, as a sys-
tem oftwo ordiyial relations, Bi- Ai and B2-A2, between the cor-
responding moments of those two moment-couples: the primary
moment Bi of the one pair being compared with the primary mo-
ment Ai of the other; and, in like manner, the secondary ynoment
B2 being compared with the secondary moment A2. But, instead
of this (analytical) comparison of moments with moments, and
thereby oipair with pair, I thought that we might also conceive
a (synthetical) generation [7] of one pair of moments from ano-
ther, by the application oi-d pair ofsteps [1 1], or by what might
be called the addition (see again [7] ), of a step-couple to a mo-
ment-couple ; and that an interpretation might thus be given to
the following identity, in the theory of couples here referred to:
(b„ 82)= {(b„ B2)-(a„ A2)J -f (a„ A2).
And other results, respecting the compositions and decomposi-
tions oi single ordinal relations, or oi single steps w time, such
;
PREFACE. (9)
as those referred to in paragraph [8] of this Preface, were easily
extended, in like manner, to the corresponding treatment ofcom-
plex relations, and of complex steps, of the kinds above described.
[13.] There was no difficulty in interpreting, on this plan,
such formulae of multiplication and division, as
a X (ai, 82) = (aai, aa^) ; (aai, aaz) -;- (ai, az) = a
where the symbols ai, 82 denote any two steps in time, and a any
number, positive or negative. But the question became less
easy, when it was required to interpret a symbol of the form
(bi, bz)-r- (a„ 82),
where bi, hi denoted two steps which could not be derived from
the two steps ai, aj, through multiplication by any single number,
such as a. To meet this case, which is indeed the general one
in this theory, I was led to introduce the conception [11] o{?ium-
ber-couples, or oipairs ofnumbers, such as (ci, a^); and to re-
gard every single number (a) as being a degenerateform of such
a number-couple, namely of {a, 0); so that the recent formula,
for the multiplication ofa step-couple by a number, might be thus
written
(«i, 0) (a„ 82) =(a'ia„ 0182).
It appeared proper to establish also the following formula, for the
multiplication ofa primary step, by an arbitrary number-couple:
(flr„ a^ (ai, 0)= (a, ai, 0281);
and to regard every such number-couple as being the sum of two
others, namely, of a pure primary and a pure secondary, as fol-
lows:
(«i, a-,) = (fli, 0) + (0, flj)
the analogous decomposition ofa step-couple having been already
established.
[14.] The difficulty of the general multiplication of a step-
couple by a number-couple came thus to be reduced to that of
assigning the product of one pure secondary by another : and the
spirit of this whole theory of couples led me to coijceive that, for
such a product, we ought to have an expression of the form,
b
;
(10) TKEFACE.
(0, Ca) (0, 82)= (7102 32, 720282);
the coefficients 71 and 72 being some two constant numbers, in-
dependent of the step 82, and of the number a^: which two coef-
ficients I proposed to call the constants of multiplication. These
constants might be variously assumed: but reasons were given
for adopting the following selection* of values, as the basis of all
subsequent operations:
71 = -
1 ; 72 = 0.
Id tMa waY-,the rea^uired law ofo^eration.^of a, general number-
couple on a general step-couple, as multiplier on multiplicand,
was found, with this choice of the constants, to be expressed by
the formula:
(«i> 02) (ai> 82)= (oi ai- Oi 82, Cz ai + a^ a^).
And in fact it was easy, with the assistance of this formula, to
interpret the quotient [13] of two step-pairs, as being always
equal to a number-pair, which could be definitely assigned, when
the ratios of the four single steps were given.
[15.] With these conceptions and notations, it was allowed to
write the two following equations
(1, 0) (a, b)= (a, b) ; (0, 1) (a, b)= (- b, a)
and I thought that these two factors, (I, 0) and (0, 1), thus used,
might be called respectively the primary unit, and the secondary
unit, of number. It was proposed to establish, by definition, for
the cliiel operations on number-pairs, a lew rules which seemecl
to be natural extensions of those already established for the cor-
responding operations [9] on single numbers: andit was seen that
because
(0, l)(-b, a)= (-a,-b)= (-l, 0)(a, b),
we were allowed, as a consequence of those rules, or of the con-
ception which had suggested them, namely, (compare [33] ), by
a certain abstraction of operators from operand, to establish the
formula,
(0, l)^= (-l,0)= -l.
* In some of my unprinted investigations, other selections of these constants
were employed.
PREFACE. (11)
Anew and (as I thought) clear interpretation was thus assigned,
for that well-known expression in algebra, the square root of ne-
gative unity: for it was found that we might consistently write,
on the foregoing plan,
(0,l)= (-l,0)i = (-!)*= /IT;
without anything obscure, impossible, or imaginary^ being in any
way involved in the conception.
[16.] In words, if after reversing the direction of the second
• of any two steps, we then transpose them, as to order; thus
making the old but reversed second step ihejirst of the new ar-
rangement, or of the new step-couple; and making, at the same
time, the old and unreversed first step the second of the same
new couple; and if we then repeat this complex process of rever-
sal and transposition, weshall, upon the whole, have restored the
order of the two steps, but shall have reversed the direction of
each. Now, it is the conceived operator, in this process of
passingfrom one pair ofsteps to another, which, in the system
here under consideration, was denoted by the celebrated sym-
bol v^-lj SO often called imaginary. And it is evident that the
process, thus described, has no special reference whatever to the
notion oi space, although it has a reference to the conception of
PROGRESSION. The symbol- 1 denoted that negative unit of
number, of which the effect, as a. factor, was to change a single
step (+ a) to its own opposite step (- a); and because two such
reversals restore, therefore (see [lOj ) the usual algebraic equa-
tion,
(-1)^= + 1,
continued to subsist, in this as in other systems. But the symbol
\/-l was regarded as not at all less real than those other symbols
-
1 or + 1, although operating on a different subject, namely, on a
pair ofsteps (a, b), and changing them to a newpair, namely,
the pair(-b, +a). And the^orm of this well-known symbol,
\/-l, as an expression (in the system here described) for what I
had previously written as (0, 1), and had called (see [15] ) the
SECONDARY UNIT of number, was justified by shewing that the
eflfect of its operation, when twice performed, reversed each step
of the pair.
(12) PREFACE.
[17.] The more general expression of algebra, Cj + \/- I r?2,
for any (so called) imagmanj root of a quadratic or other equa-
tion, was, on this plan, interpreted as being a symbol ofthe num-
ber-couple which 1 had otherwise denoted by {a^, a^); and of
which the law cooperation on a step-couple had already [14]
been assigned: as also the analogous law, thence derived,* of its
multi})lication by another number-couple, namely, that which is
expressed by the formula,
{biy bi) (oi, Gta) = (biOi -bia^, bzOi + biOz).
Ill this view, instead of saying that the usual quadratic equation,
x^ + ax + b = 0,
where a and b are supposed to denote two positive or negative
numbers, has generally two roots, real or imaginary, it would
be said that this otherform of the same equation,
(x, 2^)^ + (a, 0)(a;, y) + (6,0)= (0, 0),
is generally satisfied by two (real) number-couples; in which, ac-
cording to the values of a and 6, the secondary number (y) might
or might not be zero. An equation of this sort was called a cou-
ple-equation, and was regarded as equivalent to a system oftwo
equations^ between numbers : for example, the recent quadratic
couple-equation breaks itself up into the two following separate
equations,
x'^-y--^ ax + b= 0, 2xy + ay= 0,
which always admit ofrealand numerical solutions, whether ^a--A
be a positive or a negative number; the difference being only
that in the former case we are to take the factory= 0, of the se-
• The principles of such derivation were only hinted at in the Essay of 1835
(see page 403 of the Volume above cited): but it was perhaps sufficiently ob-
"
vious that they depended on the
separation of symbols," or on the abstraction
ofa common operand. (Compare paragraphs [15], [33], of the present Preface.)

early known to me: but it will have been perceived that I was induced to look
at the whole subject ofalgebra from a somewhat different point of view, at least
on the metaphysical side. As to the word" numbers," see a note to [33].

take the otherfactor of that equation, and to suppose 2x+ a =0.
And similar remarks might be made on equations of higher or-
ders: all notion of anything imaginary^ unreal, or impossible^
being quite excluded from the view.
[18.] The same view was extended, so as to include a theory
of powers, roots, and logarithms of number-couples; and espe-
cially to confirm a remarkable conclusion which my friend John
T. Graves, Esq., had communicated to me (and 1 believe to
others) in 1826, and had published in the Philosophical Transac-
tions for the year 1829: namely, that the general symbolical ex-
pressionfor a logarithm is to be considered as invoicing two ar-
bitrary and independent integers;* the general logarithm of
unityt to the Napierian base, being, for example, susceptible of
the form,

where a>, w denote any two whole numbers, positive or negative
or null. In fact, I arrived at an equivalent expression, in my
own theory of number-couples, under the form,
w (e, 0) (1, ^(Oir)
and generally an expression for the logarithm-couple, with the
order w, and rank w, of any proposed number-couple {y^, y^), to
any proposed base-couple (6i, b^), was investigated in such a way
as to confirmf the results of Mr. Graves.
• It 18 proper to mention, that results substantially the same, respecting the
entrance of two arbitrary whole numbers into the general form of a logarithm,
are given byOhm,in the second volume of his valuable work, entitled:
"
Versuch
eines vollkommen consequenten Systems der Mathematik, vom Professor Dr.
Martin Ohm" (Berlin, 1829, Second Edition, page 440. I have not seen the first
Edition). For other particulars respecting the history of such investigations,
on the subject of general logarithms, I must here be content to refer to Mr.
Graves's subsequent Paper, printed in the Proceedings of the Sections of the
British Association for the year 1834 (Fourth Report, pp. 523 to 531. Lon-
don, 1835).
t Another confirmation ofthe same results, derived from a peculiar theory of
conjugate functions, had been communicated by me to the British Association
(14) PREFACE.
[19.] After remarking that it was he who had proposed those
names, of orders and ranks oflogarithms^ that early Essay ofmy
own, of which a very abridged (although perhaps tedious) account
has thus been given, continued and concluded as follows:
'•But because Mr. Graves employed, in his reasoning, the usual
"
principles respecting Imaginary Quantities, and was content
"
to prove the symbolical necessity without shewing theinterpre-
*• tation, or inner meaning, ofhis formulae, the present Theory of
"
Couples is published to make manifest that hidden meaning:
"and to shew, by this remarkable instance, that expressions
*' which seem, according to common views, to be merely symbo-
"lical, and quite incapable of being interpreted, may pass into
"the world of thoughts, and acquire reality and significance, if
"
Algebra be viewed as not a mere Art or Language, but as the
" Science of Pure Time.* The author hopes to publish hereafter
at Edinburgh in 1834, and may be found reported among the Proceedings ofthe
Sections for that year, at pp. 519 to 323 of the Volume lately cited. The partial
differential *• equations of conjugation," there given, had, as I afterwards
learned, presented themselves to other writers : and the Essay on
"
Conjugate
Functions, or Algebraic Couples," there mentioned, was considerably modified,
in many respects, before its publication in 1835, in the Transactions ofthe Royal
Irish Academy.
• Perhaps I ought to apologize for having thus ventured here to reproduce
(although only historically, and as marking the progress of my own thoughts)
a view so little supported by scientific authority. I am very willing to believe
that (though not unused to calculation) I mayhave habitually attended too little
to the symbolical character of Algebra, as a Language, or organized system of
signs: and too much (in proportion) to what I have been accustomed to consider
its scientific character, as a Doctrine analogous to Geometry, through the Kan-
tian parallelism between the intuitions of Time and Space. This is not a proper
opportunity for seeking to do justice to the views of others, or to my own, on a
subject of so great subtlety: especially since, in thepresent work, I have thought
it convenient to adopt throughout a geometrical basis, for the exposition of the
theory and calculus of the Quaternions. Yet I wish to state, that I do not de-
spair of being able hereafter to shew that myown old views respecting Algebra,
perhaps modified in some respects by subsequent thought and reading, are not
fundamentally and irreconcileably opposed to the teaching of writers whom I
so much respect as Drs. Ohm and Peacock. The" Versuch," &c., of the former
I have cited (the date of the first Volume of the Second Edition is Berlin,
1828): and it need scarcely be said (at least to readers in these countries)
that my other reference is to the Algebra (Cambridge, 1830); the Report on
Certain Branche* ofAnalysis, printed in the Third Report ofthe British Associa-

'< and Integrals, and to a Theory of Triplets and Sets of Mo-
tion for the Adrancement of Science (London, 1834); the Arithmetical Algebra
(Cambridge, 1842); and the Symbolical Algebra (Cambridge, 1845): all by
the Rev. George Peacock. I by no means dispute the possibility of constructing
a consistent and useful system of algebraical calculations, by starting with the
notion of integer number ; unfolding that notion into its necessary consequences
expressing those consequences with the help of symbols, which are already ge«
neral inybrm, although supposed at first to be limited in their signification, or
value: and then, by definition, for the sake of symbolic generality, removing the re-
strictions which the original notion had imposed; and so resolving to adopt, as
perfectly general in calculation, what had been only proved to be true for a cer-
tain subordinate and limited extent of meaning. Such seems to be, at least in
part, the view taken by each of the two original and thoughtful writers who
have been referred to in the present Note: although Ohm appears to dwell more
on the study of the relations between the fundamental operations, and Peacock
more on the permanence of equivalentybrms. But I confess that I do not find my-
self able to frame a distinct conception of number, without some reference to the
thought of time, although this reference may be of a somewhat abstract and
transcendental kind. I cannot fancy myself as counting any set of things, with-
out first ordering them, and treating them as successive : however arbitrary and
mental (or subjective) this assumed succession may be. And by consenting to
begin with the abstract notion (or pure intuition) of time, as the basis ofthe ex-
position ofthose axioms and inferences which are to be expressed by the symbols
of algebra, (although I grant that the commencing with the more familiar con-
ception of whole number may be more convenient for purposes of elementary in-
struction,) it still appears to me that an advantage would be gained: because the
necessity for any merely symbolical extension of formulae would be at least consi-
derably postponed thereby. In fact (as has been partly shewn above), negatives
would then present themselves as easily and naturally as positives, through the
fundamental contrast between the thoughts of past anAfuture, used here as no
mere illustration of a result otherwise and symbolically deduced, without any
clear comprehension of its meaning, but as the very ground of the reasoning.
The ordinary imaginaries of algebra could be explained (as above) by couples ;
but might then, for convenience of calculation, be denoted by single letters, sub-
ject to all the ordinary rules, which rules wouldyb//ow (on this plan) from the
combination of distinct conceptions with definitions, and would offer no result
which was not perfectly and easily intelligible, in strict consistency with that
original thought (or intuition) of time, from which the whole theory should (on
this supposition) be evolved. The doctrine of the n roots of an equation of the
n'* degree (for example) would thus suffer no attaint as ioform, but would ac-
quire (I think) new clearness as to meaning, without any assistance from geo-
metry. The quaternions, as I have elsewhere shewn (in Vol. XXL, Part u., of
the Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy), and even the biquaternions (as I
hope to shew hereafter), might have their laws explained, and their symbolical
results interpreted, by comparisons of se/s ofmoments, and by operations on sets

'* ments, Steps, and Numbers, which includes this Theory of
*« Couples."*
[20.] The theory of triplets and sets, thus spoken of at the
close of the Essay of 1835, had in fact formed the subject of va-
rious unpublished investigations, of which some have been pre-
served : and a brief notice of them here (especially as relates to
tripletsf) may perhaps be useful, by assisting to throw light on
the nature ofthe passage, which I gradually came to make, from
couples to quaternions.
Without departing from the same general view of algebra, as
the science of pure time, it was obvious that no necessity existed
for any limitation to pairs, of moments, steps, and numbers.
Thus, instead of comparing, as in [12], two moments, Bj and B2,
with two other moments, Ai and A2, it was possible to compare
three moments, Bi, B2, B3, with three other moments, Ai, A2, A3
that is, more fully, to compare (or to conceive as compared) the
ofsteps in time. Thus,in the phraseology ofDr. Peacock, we should have a very
wide "science of suggestion" (or rather, suggestive science) as o\xr basis, on
which to build up afterwards a new structure ofpurely symbolical generalization,
if the science oftime wore adopted, instead of merely Arithmetic, or (primarily)
the doctrine of integer number. Still I admit fully that the actual calculations
suggested by this, or by any other view, must be performed according to some
fixed laws ofcombination ofsymbols, such as Professor De Morgan has sought to
reduce, for ordinary algebra, to the smallest possible compass, in his Second
Paper on the Foundation of Algebra (Camb. Phil. Trans., Vol. VII., Part ni.),
and in his work entitled" Trigonometry and Double Algebra" (London, 1849):
and that in following out such laws to their symbolical consequences, uninter-
pretable (or at least uninterpreted) results may be expected to arise. In the
present Volume (as has been already observed), I have thought it expedient to
present the quaternions under a geometrical aspect, as one which it may be per-
haps more easy and interesting to contemplate, and more immediately adapted
to the subsequent applications, of geometrical and physical kinds. And in the
passage which I have made (in the Seventh Lecture), from quaternions considered
as real (or as geometrically interpreted), to hiquaternions considered as imaginary
(or as geometrically uninterpreted), but as symbolically suggested by the gene-
ralization of quaternion formula;, it will be perceived, by those who shall do me
the honour to read this work with attention, that I have employed a method of
transition, from theorems proved for the particular to expressions assumed for the
general, which bears a very close analogy to the methods ofOhm and Peacock:
although I have since thought of a way ofgeometrically interpreting the hiquater-
nions also.

homologous moments of these two triads^ primary with primary,
secondary with secondary, and tertiary with tertiary; and so to
obtain a certain system or triad ofordinal relations, or a triad
ofsteps in time, which might be denoted (compare [6], [7], [12] )
by either member of the following equation
(Bi, B2, B3)— (Aj, A2, A3)= (Bi—Ai, B3—A], Bs— A3).
And on the same plan (compare [7], [8], [12]), if we denote the
three constituent steps of such a triad as follows,
Bj~ Ai«= aij B3— A2=a2, B3— A3 = 83,
it was allowed to write,
(Bi, B2, B3)=(ai, 82, as) + (Ai, Aj, A3)
a triad ofsteps being thus (symbolically) added (or applied) to a
triad ofmoments, so as to conduct (in thought) to another triad
ofmoments. It appeared also convenient to establish the follow*
ing formula, for the addition 0/step-triads^
0>i» bj, b3) + (ai, 82, 83)= (bi +ai, bj +82, bg + 83),
as denothig a certain composition of two such triads of steps, an-
swering to that successive application of them to any given triad
of moments (Ai, a,, A3), which conducts ultimately to a third
triad of moments, namely, to the triad (ci, C3, C3), if
Ci—Bi = Di, Cj—Bj= D2J C3— Bg^
D3.
Subtraction of one step-triad from another was explained (see
again [8]) as answering to the analogous decomposition of a
given step-triad into others; or to a system of three distinct de-
compositions of so many single steps, each into two others, of
which one was given; and it was expressed by the formula,
(Ci, C2, C3)- (ai, 82, 83) = (ci- 81, C2-82, C3-83)
while the usual rules of algebra were found to hold good, respect-
ing such additions and subtractions of triads.
[21.] Multiplication of a step-triad by a positive or negative
number (a) was easy, consisting simply in the multiplication of
each constituent step by that number; so that I had the equation,
a (81, 83, 83)= (asi, aa3, 083):

(18) PREFACE.
and conversely it was natural (compare [13] ) to establish the
following formula for a certain case ofdivision ofstep-triads^
(aai, aa2, aaj) -^ (ai, aj, aj)= a.
But in the more general case (compare again [13]), where the
steps b|, bz, ba of one triad were not proportional to the steps ai,
a2, as, it seemed to me that the quotient of these two step-triads
was to be interpreted, on the same general plan, as being equal
to a certain triad or triplet ofnumbers, a,, 02, a^-, so that there
should be conceived to exist generally two equations of the forms,
(bi, ba, ba) -^ (ai, a^, as) = (oi, Oj, 03)
(bi, bz, bg)= (ai, fla, 03) (ui, a2, a3):
the three (positive or negative) constituents of this numerical
triplet (fli, ttz, Os) depending, according to some definite laws, on
the ratios of the six steps, ai a2 83 bi b2 bj.
[22.] In this way there came to be conceived three distinct
and independent unit-steps, a primary, a secondary, and a ter-
tiary, which I denoted by the symbols,
and also three unit-numbers, primary, secondary, and tertiary,
each of which might operate, as a species offactor, or multiplier,
on each of these three steps, or on their system, and which I de-
noted by these other symbols,
xi, X2, Xj;
or sometimes more fully thus,
(1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1).
A triad ofsteps took thus the form,
rli + sli + tli,
where r, *, t were three numerical coefficients (positive or nega-
tive), although li I2 la were still supposed to denote three steps
in time; and any tripletfactor, such as {tn, n, p), by which this
step-triplet was to be multiplied, or operated upon, might be put
under the analogous form,
»jx, + nxj + py.^.
PREFACE. (19)
Continuing then to admit the distributive property of multipli-
cation, it was only necessary to fix the significations of the nine
products, or combinations, obtained by operating separately with
each of the three units of number on each of the three units of
step: every such product, or result, being conceived, in this
theory, to be itself, in general, a step-triad, of which, however,
some of the component steps might vanish. Hence, after writing
I proceeded to develope these nine step-triplets into nine trino-
mialexpressions of the forms,
h, 9 = V,5. 1 ^1 + V, 5,2 I2 + 1/, g,3 la*
where the twenty-seven symbols of the form 1^^
^ represented
certain^a:erf numerical coejfficients, or constants ofmultiplication,
analogous to those denoted by -yi and y^ in [14], and like them
requiring to have their values previously assigned, before pro-
ceeding to multiplication, if it were demanded that the operation
of a given triplet of numbers on a given triplet of steps should
produce a perfectly definite step-triad as its result.
[23.] Conversely, when once these numerical constants had
been assigned, I saw that the equation of multiplication,
(/wxi + 7JX2 4-^x3) (rli + *l2 + /l3)= xli + ylj + zls,
was to be regarded as breaking itself up, on account of the sup-
posed mutual independence of the three unit-steps, into three or-
dinary algebraical equations, between the nine numbers, m, n, p,
r, s, t, X, y, z; namely, between the coefficients of the multiplier,
multiplicand, and product. These three equations were linear^
relatively to m, n,p (as also with respect to r, s, t, and x, y, z) ;
and therefore while they gave, immediately, expressions for the
coefficients xyz of the product, and so resolved expressly the
problem of multiplication, they enabled me, through a simple
system of three linear and ordinary equations, to resolve also the
converse problem [21] of the division of one triad of steps by
another : or to determine the coefficients mnp of the following
quotient of two such triads,
wx,+ wxj +/)X3= (xli + 2/12+ zls) -7- (rli + slj + t\i).
(20) PREFACE.
[24.] Such were the most essential elements of that general
theory of triplets, which occurred to me in 1834 and 1835 : but
it is clear that, in its applications, everything depended on the
choice of the twenty-seven constants of multiplication^ which
might all be arbitrarily assumed, before proceeding to operate^
but were then to be regarded d^ifixed. It was natural, indeed, to
consider the primary number-unit x, as producing no change in
the step or triad on which it operates; and it was desirable to de-
termine the constants so as to satisfy the condition,
X3 Xj= X2 X3,
for the sake of conforming to analogies of algebra. Accordingly,
in one ofseveral triplet-systems which I tried, the constants were
so chosen as to satisfy these conditions, by the assumptions,
^1 li = iij ^1 J-z = ^2> ^1 ^z— is*
X2l|= l2, Xj l2= I1 + (6-6"^) I2, X2 I3 = 6I3,
X3li = l3, X3 12=^13, X3 l3 = li + il2+ CI3;
which still involved two arbitrary numerical constants, b and c,
and gave, by a combination of successive operations, on any ar-
bitrary step-triad (such as rli + 5I2 + tl^, whatever the coefficients
r, s, t of this operand triad might be), the following symbolic
equations,* expressing the properties ofthe assumed operators,
X2, X3, and the laws of their mutual combinations:
X2^=(6-6-')X2 + l;
X2X3 = X3 X2 = OX35
X3* = 0x3+ 6x2 + 1;
while the factor Xi was suppressed, as being simply equiva-
lent, in this system, to the factor 1, or to the ordinary unit of
number. But although the symbol Xj appeared thus to be given
by a quadratic equation, with the two real roots b and-6"*, I saw
that it would be improper to confound the operation of this pe-
culiar symbol Xj with that of either of these two numerical roots,
of that quadratic but symbolical equation, regarded as an ordi-
nary multiplier. It was not either, separately, of the two ope-

rations -x-z-b and xa+i^*, which, when performed on a general
step-triadi reduced that triad to another with every step a null
one : but the combination of these two operations, successively
(and in either order) performed.
[25.] In the same particular triplet system, the three gene-
ral equations [23] between the nine numerical coefficients, of
multiplier, multiplicand, and product, became the following:
X = mr+ns+pt;
y= ms+nr+ {b-b'^) ns + bpt;
z = mt+pr+ b{nt+ps) + cpt;
whence it was possible, in general, to determine the coefficients
m, n, p, of the quotient of any two proposed step-triads. The
same three equations were found to hold good also, when the
number-triplet (x,y, z) was considered as the symbolicalproduct
qfthe two number-triplets, (nii n^ p) and (r,Syt); this product
being obtained by a certain detachment (or separation) of the
symbols of the operators from that ofa common operand, namely
here an arbitrary step-triad. In other words, the same algebraical
equations between the nine numerical coefficients, xyZj mnp, rst,
expressed also the conditions involved in the formula of sym-
bolical multiplication,
(x, y, z)= {my n, p) (r, s, /),
regarded as an abridgment of the followingyM//er formula
(x, y, z) (ai, 32, as) = (w, n, p) (r, *, t) (ai, 82, as)
where ai, 82, 83 might denote any three steps in time. Or they
might be said to be the conditions for the correctness of this
other symbolical equation,
a;xi +yy.2 + zxj= (mxi +nxj +p^z) (rxi +5x2 +ixj),
interpreted on the same plan as the symbols y.^, XjXg, xjXj, Xg',
in [24].
[26.] All the peculiar properties of the lately mentioned
triplet system might be considered to be contained in the^three
ordinary and algebraical equations, [25], which connected the
nine coefficients with each other (and in this case with two arbi-
trary constants). And I saw that these equations admitted of
(22) PREFACB.
the three following combinations, by the ordinary processes of
algebra
x-b'^y= (in-b-^n) (r-b'^s);
X i-by + az= (m+ bn+ap) {r + bs + at) ;
X+ by + dz= (m+ bn + dp) {r + bs + dt) ;
where a, d were the two real and unequal roots of the ordinary
quadratic equation,
ei^=ca-irb^ + l.
Here, then, was an instance of what occurred in every other tri-
plet system that I tried, and seemed indeed to be a general and
necessary consequence of the cubicform of a certain function,
obtained by elimination between the three equations mentioned
in [23], at least if we still (as is natural) suppose that Xi = l:
namely, that the product oftwo triplets may vanish, without
eitherfactor vanishing. For if (as one of the ways of exhibiting
this result), we assume
n = bm, r = -bSi t = Of
the recent relations will then give
x = Of y=0, 2 = 0;
so that, whatever values may be assigned to m, p, s, we have, in
this system, the formula
(m, ftm, p) (- bs, s, 0)= (0, 0, 0).
For the same reason, there were indeterminate cases, in the ope-
ration oi division oftriplets: for example, if it were required to
find the coeflBcients mnp of a quotient, from the equation
(m, w, p) (- bs, s, 0)= {x, y, z),
we should only be able to determine the function m-b'^ n, but
not the numbers mand n themselves; while p would be entirely
undetermined: at least \{ x-\-by and z were each =0, for other-
wise there might come infinite values into play.
[27.] The foregoing reasonings respecting triplet systems
were quite independent ofany sort of geometrical interpretation.
Yet it was natural to interpret the results, and I did so, by con-
ceiving the three sets of coefficients, (m, n,p), (r, s, t), {x, y, z),

which belonged to the three triplets in the multiplication, to be
the co-ordinate projections^ on three rectangular axes, of three
right lines drawn from a common origin; which lines might (I
thought) be said to be, respectively, in this system of interpreta-
tion, the multiplier line, the multiplicand line, and the product
line. And then, in the particular triplet system recently de-
scribed, the formulae of [2(>] gave easily a simple rule, for con-
structing (on this plan) the product oftwo lines in space. For
I saw that if threefixed and rectangular lines, A^ B, C, distinct
from the original axes, were determined by the three following
pairs of ordinary equations in co-ordinates :
x+hi/ = 0, z = 0, for line A\
y -bx= 0, z- ax = 0,. . . B
y- bx= 0, z- a'x = 0,. . . C
we might then enunciate this theorem:*
"
If a line L" be the product of two other lines, Z;, L\ then
on -whichever of the three rectangular lines A, B, C we project
the two factors L, L\ the product (in the ordinary meaning) of
their two projections is equal to the product of the projections
(on the same) of L" and J7, U being the primary unit-line
(1, 0, 0)."
[28.] I saw also that it followed from this theorem, or more
immediately from the equations lately cited [26], from which the
theorem itself had been obtained, that if we considered three
rectangular planes, A', B\ C, perpendicular resj)ectively to the
three lines A, B, C, or having for their equations,
y-bx=0, (A); x + by-i^ az=0, (/?'); x + by + a'z = 0^ (C);
then every line in any one of these three fixed planes gave a null
product line, when it was multiplied by a line perpendicular to
that fixed plane: the line A, for example, as a factor, giving a
null line as the product, when combined with any factor line in
the plane A. For the same reason (compare [26] ), although
the division of one line by another gave generally a determinate

quotient-line^ yet if the divisor-line were situated in any one of
the three planes A\ By C, this quotient-line became then in-
finite^ or indeterminate. And results of the same general cha-
racter, although not all so simple as the foregoing, presented
themselves in my examinations of various other triplet systems:
there being, in all those which 1 tried, at least one system of
line and plane, analogous to {A) and {A'), but not always three
such (real) systems, nq/always at right angles to each other.
[29.] These speculations interested me at the time, and some
ofthe results appeared to be not altogether inelegant. But 1 was
dissatisfied with the departure from ordinary analogies ofalgebra,
contained in the evanescence [26] [28] of a product of two trip-
lets (or of two lines), in certain cases when neither^c<or was
null ; and in the connected indeterminateness (in the same cases)
ofa quotient, while the divisor was different from zero. There
seemed also to be too much room for arbitrary choice ofcon-
stants, and not any suflSciently decided reasons for finally prefer-
ring one triplet system to another. Indeed the assumption of
the symbolic equation [24], xj = 1, which it appeared to be conve-
nient and natural to make, although not essential to the theory,
determined immediately the values of nine out of the twenty-se-
ven constants of multiplication; and six others were obtained
from the assumptions, which also seemed to be convenient (al-
though in some of my investigations the latter was not made),
X2 li = I2J Xj li = I3.
The supposed convertibility (see again [24] ), of the order of the
two operations xj and xj, gave then the three following condi-
tions,
X3X2I1= Xj X3I1, X3X2l2= XjXalz, X3X2l3= X, X3I3,
ofwhich the first was seen at once to establish three relations be-
tween six of the twelve remaining coefficients of multiplication,
namely (if the subscript commas be here for conciseness omitted),
I23I = I32H I232~
-'•322> •'•233— •^323'
The two other equations between step-triads, given by the recent
conditions of convertibility, resolved themselves into six equa-
tions between coefficients, which were, however, perceived to be

not all independent of each other, being in fact all satisfied by
satisfying the three following:

of which the two former presented themselves to me under forms
a little simpler, because, for the sake of preserving a gradual as-
cent from couples to triplets, or for preventing a tertiary term
from appearing in the product, when no such term occurred in
either factor, 1 assumed the value,
I223~ "•
There still remained^we arbitrary coefficients,

which it seemed to be permitted to choose at pleasure: but the
decomposition of a certain cubicfunction [26] of r, s, t iniofac-
tors, combined with geometrical considerations, led me, for the
sake of securing the reality and rectangularity of a certain sys-
tem oi lines and planes, to assume the three following relations
between those coefficients:
I222— I323~ l323» I322 = "» I332 = •323 ;
which gave also the values,
1221 = 1, I321-O, 133, = 1.
But the two.constant coefficients I323 and I333 still seemed to re-
main wholly arbitrary,* and were those undetermined elements,
denoted by b and c, which entered into the formulse of triplet
multiplication [25], already cited in this Preface.
[30.] I saw, however, as has been already hinted [19] [20],
that the same general view of algebra, as the science of pure
time, admitted easily, at least in thought, of an extension of this

this at the time appeared to me unsatisfactory, nor did I see bow to interpret it

whole theory, not only from couples to triplets, but also from
triplets to sets, of moments, steps, and numbers. Instead oi two
or even three moments (as in [12] or [20] ), there was no difficulty
in conceiving a system or set of n such moments, Ai, Aj,. . a„,
and in supposing it to be compared with another equinwnerovs
momental set, Bi, Bo,. . b„, in such a manner as to conduct to a
new complex ordinal relation, or step-set., denoted by the formula,
(Bi, Bj,. . B„)- (Ai, A2,. . A„)= (Bi- Ai, Bj- A2,. . B„ - A„).
Such step-sets could be added or subtracted (compare [20] ), by
adding or subtracting their component steps, each to or from its
own corresponding step, as indicated by the double formula,
(bi, ho,. . b„) ± (ai, 82,. . a„)= (b, + ai, h^ ± a2,. . bn ± an) ;
and a step-set could be multiplied by a number (a), or divided by
another step-set, provided that the component steps of the one
were proportional to those of the other (compare [13] [21] ), by
the formulae:
a (ai, 82,. . a„)= (ffa„ aa^,. . fla„)
(aai, aai,. . aa„) -h (ai, a^,. . a„)= a.
[31.] But when it was required to divide one step-set by ano-
ther, in the more general case (compare [13] [14] [21] ), where
the components or constituent steps ai, n^,. . n„ of tlie one set
were not proportional to the corresponding components b,, bz,. .
b„ ofthe other set, a difficulty again arose, which I proposed still
to meet on the same general plan as before, by conceiving that a
numeral set, or set or system ofnumbers, (oi, Oj,. . a„), might
operate on the one set of steps, (ai, aj,. . a„), in a way analogous
to multiplication, so as to produce or generate the other given
step-set, as a result which should be analogous to aproduct. In-
stead of three distinct and independent unit-steps, as in [22], I
now conceived the existence of w such unit-steps, which might be
denoted by the symbols,
Ii, I3,. . 1„
and instead oi three unit-numbers (see again [22] ), I conceived
n such unit-operators, which in those early investigations I de-
noted
PREFACE. (27)
and of which I conceived that each might operate on each unit-
step, as a species of multiplier, orfactor^ so as to produce (gene-
rally) a new step-set as the result. There came thus to be con-
ceived a number, =w% of such resultant step-sets, denoted, on the
plan of [22], by symbols of the forms:
where the n^ symbols ofthe form '^f,g,h denoted so manynumerical
coeJicie7its, or constants ofmultiplication, ofthe kind previously
considered in the theories of couples [14], and of triplets [22],
which all required to have their values previously assumed, or
assigned, before proceeding to multiply a step-set by a number-
set, in order that this operation might give generally a definite
step-set as the result.

values of these coefficients or constants 1/,^,* had been once fixed,
I saw that we could then definitely interpret a product of the
form,
(mxi+. . +mjx^+ . .nin^n) {riU+. + rj\f->r. .+r„l„),
where m^. . nig,. . Mn and ri,. . rj,. . ;•„ were any 2n given
numbers, as being equivalent to a certain new or derived step-
set of the form,
where x^,. . x^,. . Xn were n new or derived numbers, determined
by n expressions such as the following:
Xh = '2imyrflj^y^h;
the summation extending to all the n- combinations of values of
the indices / and g. And because these expressions might in
general be treated as a system of n linear equations between the
n coefficients w,, ofthe multiplier set, I thought that the division
ofone step-set by another (compare [14] [23]), might thus in
general be accomplished, or at least conceived and interpreted,
as being the process of returnitiy to that multiplier, or of deter-
mining the numeral set which would produce the dividend step-
set, by operating on the divisor step-set, and which might there-
fore be denoted as follows :

or more concisely thus,

while the numeral set thus found might be culled the quotient of
the two step-sets.
[33.] It may be remembered that even at so early a stage as
the interpretation of the symbol i x a, for the algebraic product
of two positive or negative mimhers,* it had been proposed to
conceive a reference to a step (a), which should be first operated
on by those two numbers successively, and then abstractedfrom^
as was expressed by the elementary formula [9],
(i X a) X a = 6 X (a X a).
Thus to interpret the product -2x-3as=+ 6, I conceived that
some time-step (a) was first tripled in length and reversed in di-
rection ; then that the new step (-3a) was doubled and reversed;
and finally that the last resultant step (+ 6a) was compared with
the original step (a), in the way of algebraic ratio [9], thereby
conducting to a result which was independent of that original
step. All this, so far, was no doubt extremely easy; nor was it
difficult to extend the same mode of interpretation to the case
[17] of the multiplication of two number couples, and to inter-
pret the product of two such couples as satisfying the condition,
(bi, Ih) (ou a.) X (a,, a,) = (6i, bS) x (a,, a-z) (ai, a^)
the arbitrary step-couple (aj, a^) being first operated on, and af-
terwards abstracted from. In like manner, in the theory of
triplets, it was found possible [24] [25] to abstractfrom an ope-
rand step-triad, and thereby to obtain formulae for the symbolic

still more general multiplication ofnumeral sets, new difficulties
were introduced by the essential complexity of the subject, on
which I can only touch in the briefest manner here,*

ral plan, and with the same particular constants ofmultiplication,
on this new step-set, by a new number-set, such as Sw/^x,^-, and

where l'g,g;g» is one of a new system ofn^ numerical coefficients^
and the sum involves n terms, answering to n different values of

the multii)iication of numeral sets breaks itself up into n equa-
tions, of the form,
the summation here extending to w^ terms arising from the com-
binations of the values of the indices g and g. For all such

and conversely, if we can satisfy these n^ equations between step-
Bets, we shall thereby satisfy the conditions ofdetachment [34],
which we have at present in view. But each of these n^ equa-

pp. 228 to 235), by Dr. Peacock, whose remarks upon their ^-ritings, and whose
own investigations on the subject, are well entitled to attennon. As relates to
the method described above (in paragraph [30] ofthis Prefase), if niuUipUcation
(as well as addition) ofdirected lines in one plane be regardec^as I think it ought
to be) as an essential element thereof, I venture here to stat the impression on
my own mind, that the true inventor, or at least ihefirst d^nite promuhjator of
that method, will be found to have been Argand, in 1806: ^though his" Essai
sur une Maniere de representor Ics Quantites Imaginaires," r^hich was published
at Paris in that year, is known to me only by Dr. Peacock'srmention of it in his
Report, and by the account of the same Essay given in the course of a subse-
quent correspondence, or series of communications (which abo has been noticed
in that Report,and was in consequence consulted a few yea s ago by me), car-
ried on between Fran9ais, Servois, Gergonnc, and Argand hanself; which series
of papers was published in Gergonne's Annales des Mathtnmtiques, in or about
the year 1813. My recollection of that correspondence is, t_at it was admitted
to establish fully the priority of Argand to Francais, as rt^arded the method
[30] of (not merely adding, but) multiplying together directei lines in one plane,
which is briefly described above: and which was afterwarcb independently re-
produced, by Warren in 1828, and in the same year by Mou-cy, in a work enti-
tled:

heard), for operations on right lines in one plane: which method
had given a species of geometrical interpretation to the usual
and well-known imaginary symbol of algebra. In the method
thus referred to, addition oflines was performed according to the
same rules as composition ofmotions^ or of forces, by drawing
Imaginaires" (Paris, 1828). If the list of such independent re-inventors of this
important and modern method of constructing by a line the product oftwo di-
rected lines in onefixed plane (from which it is to be remarked, in passing, that
my own mode of representing by a quaternion the product of two directed lines
in space is altogether different) were to be continued, it would include, as I have
lately learned, the illustrious name of Gauss, in connexion with his Theory
of Biquadratic Residues (Gottingen, 1832). On the other hand, I cannot per-
ceive that any distinct anticipation of this method of multiplication ofdirected lines
is contained in Bute's vague but original and often cited Paper, entitled
" Me-
moirc sur les Quantitcs Imaginaires," which appeared in the Philosophical
Transactions (of London) for 180G, having been read in June, 1803. The inge-
nious autlior of that Paper had undoubtedly formed the notion of representing the
directions oflines by algebraical symbols; he even uses (in No. 35 ofhis Memoir)
such expressions as V2 (cos 45 + sin 45' V - 1) to denote two different and di-
rected dici(/oiials ofa square: and there is the high authority of Peacocli (Report,
p. 228), for considering that tlie geometrical interpretation of the symbol V-1,
as denoting pcrpcndicnlurity, was "first formally maintained by Buee, though
more tlian once suggested by other authors." In No. 43 of the Paper referred
to, Buee constructs with much elegance, by a bent line ake, or by an inclined
line AR (wlicre ke is a ptu'pondicular,= }.n, erected at tlio middle point K of a
given lino ab, or a), an imnijinanj root (.r) ofthe (juadratic equation, x (a—x)= § a^,
wiiieh liad been proposed by Carnot (in p. 54 of the Geonietrie de Position, Pa-
ris, 1804). But when lie proceeds to explain (in No. 40 of his Paper) in what
sense he regards the two lines ae and eb (or the two constructed roots of the
quadratic) as iiaving their product equal to the given value J a^ or i ab", Buee ex-
pressl;/ limits tiic signification of such a product to the result obtained by multi-
plying the arithmetical values, and expressly excludes the consideration of the
positions ofthefactor-lines from his conception of their multiplication: whereas
it seems to me to belong to the very essence of the method [36J of Argand and
other.s, and generally to that system of geometrical interpretation whereon is
based what Professor De Morgan has happily named Double Algebra, to take
account ofthose positions (or directions), when lines are to be multiplied together.
My oicn conception (as has been already hinted, and as will appear fully in the
course of this work), of the product of two directed lines in space as a quater-
nion, is altogether distinct, both from the purely arithmetical product of nume-
rical values of Bu^e, and from the linear product (or third coplanar line), in the
method of Argand: yet I have thought it proper to submit the foregoing re-
marks, on the invention of this latter method, to the judgment of persons
better versed than myself in scientific history. A few additional remarks and
references on the subject will be found in a subsequent Note.

the diagonal of a parallelogram; and the multiplication of two
lines, in a given plane, corresponded to the construction of a
species o^fourth proportional^ to un assumed line in the same
plane, selected as the representative oipositive unity, and to the
two ^xo^o^qAfactor-lines: such fourth proportional, ox product-
line, being inclined to one factor-line at the same angle, measured
in the same sense, as that at which the other factor-line was in-
clined to the assumed unit-line ; while its length was, in the old
and usual signification of the words, a fourth proportional to the
lengths of the unit-line and the two factor-lines. Subtraction,
division, elevation to powers, and extraction of roots, were ex-
plained and constructed on the same general principles, and by
processes of the same general character, which may easily be con-
ceived from the slight sketch just given, and indeed are by this
time known to a pretty wide circle of readers : and thus, no doubt,

derived from a particular case of Functional Projections" (London, 1818), that
"
the celebrated Dr. Wallis of Oxford, in his
Treatise of Algebra" (London,
1685), proposed to interpret the imaginary roots of a quadratic equation, by
going out ofthe line, on which if real they should be measured. Thus Wallis (in
his chapter Ixvii.) observes:
—" So that whereas in case of Negative Roots we
"are to say, the point b cannot be found, so as is supposed in ac Forward, but
"Backward it may in the same Line: we must here say, in case of a Negative

Square, the point B cannot be found so as was supposed, in the Line ac; but
"Above that Line it may in the same Plain. This I have the more largely in-
"sisted on, because the Notion (I think) is new; and this, the plainest Deciara-
"tion that at present I can think of, to explicate what we commonly call the
"Imaginary Roots of Quadratick Equations. For such are these." And again
(in his following chapter Ixviii., at page 269), Wallis proposes to construct thus
the roots of the equation aa +6a+<c =0:—"On A.ca = b, bisected in c, erect a
"perpendicular cp =Va;. And taking pb= ^i, make (on whether side you please
"of cp), PBC, a rectangled triangle. Whose right angle will therefore be at c

present positive unity. But when it was proposed to leave the
plane, and to construct a system which should have some general
analogy to the known system thus described, but should extend
to space,* then difficulties of a new character arose, in the endea-
"
Imaginary if at B." These passages must always (I think) possess an histo-
rical interest, as exemplifying the manner in which, in the seventeenth century,
one so eminent for his powers of interpretation of analytical expressions, as Dr.
Wallis was, sought to apply those powers to the geometrical construction of the
imaginary roots ofan equation: and for the decision with which he held that such
roots were quite as clearly interpretable, as
" what we call real" values. His par-
ticular interpretation of those imaginary roots of a quadratic appears indeed to
me to be inferior in elegance to that which was long afterwards proposed by
Buee. Bui it may be noticed that, whether his point b were on or offthe line
Aca, Wallis seems (like Buee, and many other and more modern writers) to have
regarded that right line, as being in some sense a sum, or at least analogous to a
stim, of the two successive lines ab, na ; which latter lines conduct, upon the
whole, from the initial point A to the final point a ; and construct according to
him the two roots of the quadratic, whose algebraic sum is =b. Indeed, Wallis
remarks (in the same page 269) that when those two roots are algebraically ima-
ginary, or are geometrically constructed (according to him) by the help ofa point
B which is above the line ACa, then that straight line is not equal to the aggregate
of AB 4- Ba ; but this seems to be no more than guarding himself against being
supposed to assert, that two sides of a triangle can be equal in length to the
third. In chap. Ixix., p. 272, he thus sums up:—" We find therefore, that in
•• Equations, whether Lateral or Quadratick, which in the strict Sense, and first
"
Prospect, appear Impossible; some mitigation may be allowed to make them
"
Possible ; and in such a mitigated interpretation they may yet be useful." For
lateral equations (equations of the first degree), the mitigation here spoken of
consists simply in the usual representation of negative roots, by lines drawn back-
ward from a point, whereas they had been at first supposed to be drawnforward.
For quadratic equations with imaginary roots, Wallis mitigates the problem, by
substituting a bent line Asa for that straight line ACa, which constructs the given
algebraical sum (6) of the two roots of the equation, or parts ofthe bent line,
AB, Ba. It is also to be noticed that he appears to have regarded the algebraical
semi-difference ofthose two roots, ab, Ba, as being in all cases constructed bythe
line BC, drawn to the middle point c ofthe line Aa: which would again agree with
many modern systems. Thus Wallis seems to have possessed, in 1683, at least in
germ (for I do not pretend that he fully and consciously possessed them), some
elements of the modern methods of Addition and Subtraction of directed lines.
But on the equally essential point o( Multiplication of directed lines in one plane,
it does not appear that Wallis,any more than Buee (see the foregoing Note), had
anticipated the method of Argand.

ready mentioned (Mr. John T. Graves), who felt the wish, and
formed the project, to surmount them in some way or other, as
early, or perhaps earlier than myself.
[37.] A conjecture respecting such extension of the rule of
multiplication of lines, from the plane to space, which long ago
occurred to me (in 1831), may be stated briefly here, as an illus-
tration of the general character of those old speculations. Let
A denote a point assumed on the surface of a fixed sphere, de-
scribed about the origin o of co-ordinates, with a radius equal to
the unit of length; and let this point a be called the unit-point.
Let also b and c be supposed to be two factor-points, on the
same surface, representing the directions oa, ob, of the tvfofac-
tor-lines in space, of which lines it is required to perform, or to
interpret, the multiplication; and so to determine, by some fixed
rule to be assigned, the product-point d, or the direction of the
product-line, od. Then it appeared that the analogy to opera-
tions in the plane might be not ill observed, by conceiving d to
be taken on the circle abc ; the arcs, ab, cd, of that (generally)
small circle ofthe sphere being equally long, and similarly mea-
sured; so that the two chords ad, bc should be parallel: while
the old rule of multiplication oflengths should be retained : and
addition oflines be still interpreted as before. But in this sys-
tem there were found to enter radicals siudfractions into the ex-
pressions for the co-ordinates* of a product; and although the
case of squares oflines, or products of equal factors, might be
rendered determinate by agreeing to take the great circle ab,
when the point c coincided with b, yet there seemed to be an es-
sential indetermination in the construction of the reciprocal of a
line: it being suflScient, according to the definition here consi-

dered, to take the chord bc parallel to the tangent plane to the
sphere at the unit-point, in order to make the product point d
coincide with that point a. There was also the great and (as I
thought) fatal objection to this method of construction, that it
did not preserve the distributive principle of multiplication; a
product ofsums not being equal, in it, to the sum ofthe products:
and on the whole, I abandoned the conjecture.
[38.] Another construction, of a somewhat similar character,
and liable to similar objections, for the product of two lines in
space, occurred to me in 1835, and also independently to Mr. J.
T. Graves in 1836, in which year he wrote to me on the subject.
It may be briefly stated, by saying that instead of considering,
as in the last-mentioned system, the small circle abc, and draw-
ing the chord ad, from unit-point to product-point, so as to be
parallel to the chord bc from one factor-point to the other, it was
now the arc ad of a great circle on the sphere, which was to be
drawn so as to bisect the arc bc, of another great circle, and be
bisected thereby. Or as Mr. Graves afterwards expressed to me
—
the rule in question:
" Bisect the inclination ofthe factor-lines,
and then double forward the angle between the linear unit and
the bisecting line:" the rule of multiplying lengths being under-
stood to be still observed. Mr. Graves made several acute re-
marks on the consequences of this construction, and proposed a
few supplementary ?^les to remove the porismatic character of
some of them: but observed that, with these interpretations, the
square-root ofthe negative unit-line^ or the triplet (-1, 0, 0)^,
would still be indeterminate, and of the form (0, cos 0, sin 0),
where remained arbitrary: while cases might arise, in which the
"minutest alteration" ofa factor-line would make a "considerable
change" in the position of the product-line: and this result he
"
conceived to be, or to lead to,
a breach of the grand property
of multiplication," respecting its operation on a sum. He left to
"
me the investigation of the general expressions for the
consti-
"
tuent co-ordinates" of the resultant
triplet," or product-line, in
terms of the constituents ofthe factors: and in fact I had already
obtained such expressions, and had found them to involve radi-
cals and fractions, and to violate the distributive principle, as in
the system recently described [37]; with which indeed the one

here mentioned had been perceived by me to have a very close
analytical connexion.*
[39.] Mr. J. T. Graves, however, communicated to me at the
same time another method, which he said that he preferred^
"
among all the modes that he had tried,
of representing lines in
space, and of multiplying such lines together." This method
consisted in considering such a line as a species of" compound
couple," or as determined by two couples, one in the plane of xy,
and the other perpendicular to that plane: it having been easily
perceived that the rules proposed by me for the addition and
multiplication [17] of couples, agreed in all respects with the pre-
viously known method [36], of representing the operations ofthe
same names on lines in oneplane. From this conception of com-
"
pound couples Mr. Graves derived a
general rule for the multi-
plication of triplets," which I shall here transcribe,t only abridg-
ing the notation by writing p and pi to represent the radicals
\/{x'^ +y^) and \/(^i' +2/iO'^^ ^^^ projections of the factor-lines

attention: but 1 have thought it deserving of being put on re-
cord here, especially as, by a remarkable coincidence, it came to
be independently and otherwise arrived at by another member of
the same family, at a date later by ten years, and to be again
communicated to me.* And perhaps I may be excused if I here
leave the order of time, to give some short account of the train
of thought by which his brother, the Rev. Charles Graves, ap-
pears to have been conducted, in 1846, to precisely the same re-
lations between the constituents of three triplets.
[40.] Professor Graves employed a system of two new ima-
ginaries, i and^", of which he conceived that i had the effect of
causing a rotation (generally conical) through 90° round the axis
of z, whiles' caused a line to revolve through an equal angle in
its own vertical plane (that is, in the plane of the line and of z)\
and then he proceeded to multiply together the two triplets
a; + iy +jzj x' + iy'+js^, by a peculiar process, and so to obtain a
third triplet x"+iy"+jz": the relations thus resulting, between
the co-ordinates or constituents, being (as it turned out) identi-
cal with those which his brother had formerly found. These
symbolsI andJ were each a sort offourth root ofunity: and the
first, but 7iot the second, had the property of operating on a sum
by operating on each of its parts separately. Thus, as Profes-
sor Graves remarked, multiplication of triplets, on this plan,
would not be a distributive operation, although it would be a
commutative one. The method conducted him to an elegant ex-
ponential expression for a line in space, namely, rc^'f-'^ where r
was the radius vector, and /, X might be called the longitude and
latitude of the line, so that the co-ordinate projections were
(some peculiar considerations being employed in order to justify
these expressions of them, as connected with that of the line)
x = r cos / cos \, y = r sin I cos A, z = r sin X.

the lengths being thus multiplied (as in the other systems above
mentioned), but the longitudes and latitudes of the one line being
respectively added to those of the other ; which was in fact the
rule expressed by Mr. J. T. Graves's co-ordinate formulae [39].
[41.] It will not (1 hope) be considered as claiming any me-
rit to myselfin this matter, but merely as recording an unpursued
guess, which may assist to illustrate this whole inquiry, if I ven-
ture to mention here that the^r*^ conjecture respecting geometri-
cal triplets, which I find noted among my papers (so long iigo as
1830), was, that while lines in space might be at/rferf according
to the same rule as in the plane, they might be multiplied by
multiplying their lengths, and adding their polar angles. In the
method [36], known to methen as that of Mr.Warren, if we write
x=r cos 0, y=r sin 9, we have, for multiplication within the
plane, equations which may be written thus, r" = rr', 0"=0+ 6'. It
hence occurred to me, that if we employed for space these other
known transformations of rectangular to polar co-ordinates,
x=r cosO, y=r sin cos <p, z = r sin sin 0,
it might be natural to dejine multiplication of lines in space by
the slightly extended but analogous formulae,
r" = rr', B"=B + &, f= ^ + f
which, however, conducted to radicals, as in the expression,
x"=XX - {y^ + 2^)* (y'2 + z'2)i,
whereas within the plane there were rational values for the rect-
angular co-ordinates of the product, namely (compare [17] ),
x" = XX- yy', y"= xy + y^'.
But this old (and uncommunicated) conjecture of mine, which
was inconsistent with the distributive principle, though possess-
ing some general resemblance to the lately mentioned results [39]
[40] of Messrs. John and Charles Graves, cannot be considered
to have been an anticipation of them. For while we all agreed
in adding the longitudes of the two factors (in the sense lately
mentioned), they added latitudes also; while I, less happily, had
thought o{ adding the colatitudes, or the angular distances from
a line (x), instead of those from a plane (xy). And this diffe-
(40) PREFACE,
rence of plan produced a very important difference of results.
Indeed the two systems are totally distinct, although there exists
some sort of analogy between them.
[42.] I shall here mention one more system, which was com-
municated to me* in 1840, by the elder of those two brothers,
and which involved a method of representing the usual imagi-
nary quantities of algebra, each by a corresponding unique point
on the surface ofa sphere^ described (as in [37] ) about the ori-
gin with a radius= 1: whence it appeared that the ordinary ima-
ginary expression r (cos d + V^- 1 sin Q) might be denoted by a
triplet (x, y, z), under the condition, ^2 + y^ + 2^^ =1: and that the
rules thus obtained, for the multiplication oi such triplets, might
perhaps afford some analogy, suggesting rulcsf for the more ge-
neral case, where the constituents x,y, z are wholly independent
of each other. Mr. J. T. Graves's
" mode of representing quan-
tity spherically" was stated by him to me as follows:—"All po-
"
sitive quantities r may be represented by points on an assumed
<' semicircle, by taking the extremity ofthe arc 2 tan'^ r (counted
*' from one end (a) of the semicircle) to represent r. Next let us
*• consider our sphere as generated by the revolution of the semi-
«' circle:}: abc round the axis ac (forwards or backwards, according
"
to arbitrary convention). When the semicircle has moved
*' through an angle 0, let the position of a point on its circumfe-
<' rence denote r (cos 0+ \^- 1 sin 0), if the same point in its ori-
"
ginal position denoted r." I make a very easy transformation
of this statement, when I present it thus:—Construct all quan-
tities (so called), real and imaginary, according to the known me-
thod already described in [36], by drawing right lines from
the assumed point (a) of the unit-sphere, in the tangent plane at
that point; double all the lines so drawn, and treat the ends of

+ Mr. Graves appears not to have actually worked out such rules, at least I
do not find that he communicated them to me. They would probably havebeen,
on the plan described in [42], to have multiplied (as before) the lengths, and (as
before) added the longitudes: but to have then multiplied the tangents ofthe halves
ofthe colatitudes of the factors, in order to obtain the tangent of the half of the
colatitude of the product.

the doubled lines as the stereographic projections of points upon
the sphere. Infinity was thus represented, in the particular system
of Mr. Graves here described, by the point diametrically oppo-
site to A. And in this endeavour of mine, to furnish faithfully a
record ofevery circumstance, which, even as remotely suggesting
to di friend a train of thought, may have indirectly stimulated
myself I must not suppress the following acknowledgment of
Mr. J. T.Graves:—"What led me to this was a passage in
"a letter from De Morgan,* in which he expressed a wish to be
** able to represent quantity circularly^ in order to explain the
*' passage from positive to negative through infinity."
[43.] The foregoing specimens may suffice to exemplify the
attempts which were made, a considerable number of years ago,
by Mr. Graves and by myself: on the one hand, to extend to
space that geometrical construction for the multiplication oflines,
which was known to us from the work of Mr. Warren; and on
the other hand, to render more entirely definite my conception of
algebraical triplets. I will not here trouble my readers with any
further account of the conjectures on those subjects which at va-
rious times occurred to him or me, before 1 was led to the qua-
ternions, in a way which I shall presently explain. But I wish
to mention first, that among the circumstances which assisted to
prevent me from losing sight of the general subject, and from
wholly abandoning the attempt to turn to some useful account
those early speculations of mine, on triplets and on sets, was pro-
bably the publication of Professor De Morgan's first Paper on
the Foundation of Algebra,t of which he sent me a copy in 1841.
In that Paper, besides the discussion of other and more impor-
tant topics, my Essay on Pure Time was noticed, in a free but
friendly spirit; and the subject of triplets was alluded to, in such
—
passages, for instance, as the following:
" But in this branch
of logical algebra" (that referred to in paragraph [36] of the pre-
sent Preface), "the lines must be all in one plane, or at least
affected by only one modification of direction : the branch which
shall apply to a line drawn in any direction from a point, or mo-

extension to geometry of three* dimensions is not practicable
until we can assign two symbols, Q, and w, such that a + bQ+ cw
= ai + biQi + CiU} gives a =ai, b=bi, andc= Ci: and no definite
symbol of ordinary algebra will fulfil this condition." My sym-
bols Xj, X3 (of 1834-5) had not then been published, nor other-
wise exhibited to him ; they were designed to fulfil precisely the
foregoing conditions : but I was not myself satisfied with them,
as not considering them"

[44.] In the early numbers of the Cambridge Mathematical
Journal, there appeared some ingenious and original Papers, by
the late Mr. Gregory and by other able analysts, on the signs +
and -, on the powers of +, on branches of curves in different
planes, and on other connected subjects: but I hope that it will
not be thought disrespectful if I confess that I do not remember
their having had much influence on my own trains of thought.
Perhaps 1 was not suflBciently prepared, or disposed, to look at
algebra generally, and its applications to geometry, from the
same point of view, and was thereby prevented from studying
those Papers with the requisite attention. At least, if anything
in my own views shall be found to be inconsistent with those put
forward in the Papers thus alluded to, I wish it to be considered
as offered with every deference, and not in a controversial spirit.
And if for the present I omit all further mention of them, it is
partly because, without a closer study, I should fear to do them
injustice: and partly because 1 make no pretensions to be here
• Professor De Morgan proposed at the same time a remarkable conjecture,
which he maybe considered to have afterwards illustrated and systematised, by
his theory oi cube-roots of negative unity, employed as geometrical operators, in
his Paper on Triple Algebra (Camb. Phil. Trans., Vol. VIII., Part, iii.); namely,
"
that
an extension to three dimensions" might" require a solution of the equa-
tion (p^ x=-X." I much regret that my plan will not allow me to attempt the
giving any further account, in this Preface, of that very original Paper of Pro-
fessor De Morgan, the first suggestion of which he was pleased to attribute to
the publication of my own remarks on Quaternions, in the Philosophical Maga-
zine for July, 1844: and a similar expression ofregret applies to the independent
but somewhat later researches of Messrs. John and Charles Graves, in the same
year, respecting other Triplet Systems, which involved cube-roots of positive
unity, and of which some account has been preserved in the Proceedings of the
Royal Irish Academy.

speculation, or to give anything more than an account ofthe pro-
gress ofmy own thoughts, upon one class of subjects. For the
same reasons, I pass over some other investigations having refe-
rence to the imaginary* symbol of algebra, which were not used
as suggestions by myself, and proceed at once to the quaternions.
[45.] With such preparations as I have described, I resumed
(in 1843) the endeavour to adapt the general conception of trip-
lets to the multiplication of lines in space, resolving to retainihe
distributive principle, with which some formerly conjectured sys-
tems had been inconsistent, and at first supposing that I could
preserve the commutative principle also, or the convertibility
[24] [29] of the factors as to their order. Instead of my old
symbols xj, x^, xs (see [22] ), I wrote more shortly 1, i,j; so that
a numerical triplet took the form x + iy +jz, where I proposed to
interpret a;, y, z as three rectangular co-ordinates, and the trip-
let itself as denoting a line in space. From the analogy of cou-
• I am unwilling, however, to leare unmentioned here (although it did not
happen to supply me with any suggestion), a remarkable use of the symbol
V-1, which was made by the late Professor Mac Cullagh, ofDublin, whose great
and original powers in mathematical and physical science must ever be remem-
bered with admiration, and which he seems to have connected (in 1843) with in-
Testigations respecting the total reflexion of light. (See Proceedings of the
R. I. A. for the date of January 13, 1845.) This use of imaginaries was founded
on a theorem relative to the ellipse, which was expressed by him as follows, in
a question proposed at the Examination for the Election of Junior Fellows in
1842 (see Dublin University Examination Papers for that year, published in
—
1843, p. Ixxxiv.):
" Detur in spatio ellipsis, cujus centrum est origo co-ordina-
tarum. Puncta xyz, x y'z in ellipsi sint termini diametrorum conjugatarum.
Ostendendum est quantitates imaginarias
x+jt'V-I Z + jr'V-l'
constantes esse pro quolibet systemate diametrorum conjugatarum." This
elegant theorem of Professor Mac Cullagh may easily be proved, without em*
ploying any but the usual principles respecting the symbol V-l, by observing
that the following expressions, for the six co-ordinates in question,
x =a cos v + a' sin V, y = b cos « +6 sin v, z=c cos v + c sin d,
X =a cos V—a sin t;, y = b' cos v— b sin v, z =c' cos «—

pies, 1 assumed i^=- 1 ; and tried the effect of assuming also
J*
=- 1, which I interpreted as answering to a rotation through
two right angles in the plane of xz, as i* = -l had corresponded
to such a rotation in the plane of xy. And because I at first
supposed that zjandjt were to be equals as in the ordinary cal-
culations of algebra, the product of two triplets appeared to take
the form,
(a + ib +jc) (x + }y +jz)= (ax-by- cz) + i (ay + bx)
+y (az + ex) + ij (bz + cy):
but I did not at once see what to do with ihQ product ij. The
theory of triplets seemed to require that it should be itself a
triplet, of the form,
ij = a^ i^ +jy,
the coefficients a, /3, 7 being some three constant numbers : but
the question arose, how were those numbers to be determined, so
as to adapt in the best way the resulting formuJa of multiplica-
tion to some guiding geometrical analogies.
[46.] To assist myself in applying such analogies, I consi-
dered the case where the co-ordinates b, c were proportional to
y, z, so that the two factor-lines were in one common plane, con-
taining the unit-line, or the axis of x. In that particular case,
there was ready a known signification [36] for the product line,
considered as the fourth proportional to the unit-line (assumed
here on the last-mentioned axis), and to the two coplanar factor-
lines. And I found, without difficulty, that the co-ordinate pro-
jections of such a fourth proportional were here,
ax -by-cz, ay + bx, az + ex,
that is to say, the coefficients of 1, i,j, in the recently written
expression for the product of the two triplets, which had been
supposed to represent the factor-lines. In fact, if we assume
y =Xb, z = Xc, where X is any coefficient, we have the two iden-
tical equations,
(ax - Xb'- Xc^)- + (Xa + xY(b' + c') = (a' + b' +c^) (x^ + X'b' + X' c'),

which express that the required geometrical conditions are satis-
fied. It was allowed then, in this case ofcoplanarity^ or under
the particular condition^
bz- cy = 0,
to treat the triplet,
(ax- by- cz) + i (ay + bx) +J(az + ex),
as denoting a line which might, consistently with known analo-
gies, be regarded as the product of the two lines denoted by the
two proposed triplets,
a + ib +jc, and x + iy \jz.
And here ihefourth term,
ij(bz+cy)y
appeared to be simply swperfiuous: which induced me for a mo-
ment to fancy that perhaps the "product ij was to be regarded as
= 0. But I saw that this fourth term (or part) of the product
was more immediately given, in the calculation, as the sum of
the two following,
ib.jz, jc.iy,
and that this sum would vanish, under the present condition

namely, the supposition (for which my old speculations on sets
had prepared me) that
«;=->':
or that
V= + h,ji= -ky
the value of the product k being still left undetermined.
[47.] In this manner, without now assuming bz-cy-0, I
had generally for the product oftwo triplets, the expression of
quadrinomialform
,
(a + ib +jc) (x +iy +jz)= (ax -by- cz) + i (ay + bx)
+j (az+ ex) + k (bz-cy) ;
and I saw that although the product of the sums of squares of
the constituents of the two factors could not in general be decom-
posed into three squares of rational functions of them, yet it
could be generally presented as the sum offour such squares,
(46) PREFACE.
namely, the squares of the four coefficients of 1, i,j\ k, in the
expression just deduced: for, without any relation being assumed
between a, i, c, a?, y, z, there was the identity,
(a^ + 6' + c^) {x^ + y^ -{ z"") =^ {ax- bi/- czf + {ay + 6a;)»
+ {az + ca;)* + (6^- cyy.
This led me to conceive that perhaps instead of seeking to con-
fine ourselves to triplets, such as a+ib +Jc or {a, b, c), we ought
to regard these as only imperfectforms o/quaternions, such as
a+ ib+jc+ kd, or (a, 6, c, d), the symbol k denoting some new
sort of unit operator: and that thus my old conception o{ sets
[30] might receive a new and useful application. But it was ne-
cessary, for operating definitely with such quaternions, to fix the
value of the square k^, of this new symbol k, and also the values
of the products, ik^jk, ki, kj. It seemed natural, after assuming
as above that i^=f=- 1, and that ij =k,ji= -ky to assume also
that ki =-ik=- i^j= +j, and kj= -jk=fi =- i. The assump-
tion to be made respecting h} was less obvious ; and I was for a
while disposed to consider this square as equal to positive unity,
because i^f=+ 1 : but it appeared more convenient to, suppose, in
consistency with the foregoing expressions for the products of
i,jy ky that
k"" = ijij=- iijj= -i'f=- {-\) {-\)= -\.
[48.] Thus all the fundamental assumptions for the multipli-
cation oftwo quaternions were completed, and were included in
the formulae,
i'i =y^= ^2 =-1 ; ij =-ji= k
; jk=-kj= i; ki=- ik =j:
which gave me the equation,
(a, 6, c, d) (a, b\ c', d')= (a", b\ c", d"),
or
(a +ib -^jc + kd) {a + ib' +jc'+kd")=a"+ib" +jc"+ kd",
when and only when the followingyowr separate equations were
satisfied by the constituents ofthese three quaternions:
a" =aa'-bb'-cc- dd\
b" = {ab' + ba') + {cd'-dc),
c"-= {ac +ca') + {db'- bd'),
d'= {ad'+ da) + {be- cb').
PREFACE. (47)
And I perceived on trial, for I was not acquainted with a theorem
of Euler respecting sums offour squares, which might have
enabled me to anticipate the result, that these expressions for
a", b", c", d" had the following modularproperty
q"2 + ^"2 + c"2 + d"2 =(a^ + b' + c^ + d^) (a'^ + b'' + c' + d'^).
I saw also that if, instead of representing a line by a triplet of
the form x + iy +jZf we should agree to represent it by this other
trinomialform,
ix ^jy+ Az,
we should then be able to express the desired product oftwo lines
in space by a quaternion, of which the constituents have very
simple geometrical significations, namely, by the following,
{ix -irjy + kz) (ix -^jy +hz)= w"+ ix -¥Jy" + kz",
where
w"=-xx-
yy-z£y
x"-yzf- zy\ y"= za/-xz\ z" = xy- yx';
so that the part w'\ independent of i;/t, in this expression for the
product, represents \)s\q product ofthe lengths ofthe twofactor-
lines, multiplied by the cosine ofthe supplement oftheir inclina-
tion to each other; and the remaining part ix" -^jy"+kz" of the
same product of the two trinomials represents a line, which is in
length the product ofthe same two lengths, multiplied by the sine
ofthe same inclination, while in direction it is perpendicular to
the plane ofthefactor-lines, and is such that the rotation round
the multiplier-line, from the multiplicand-line towards the pro-
duct-line (or towards the line-part of the whole quaternion pro-
duct), has the same right-handed (or left-handed) character, as
the rotation round the positive semiaxis of^ (or of 2), from the
positive semiaxis of i (or ofx), towards that oij (or of y).
[49.] When the conception, above described, had been so far
unfolded and fixed in my mind, I felt that the new instrument for
applying calculation to geometry, for which 1 had so long sought,
was now, at least in part, attained. And although 1 had left se-
veral former conjectures respecting /r?jo/e/5 for many years uncom-
municated, except by name, even to friends, yet 1 at once pro-
ceeded to lay these results respecting quaternions before the

1843,and at a General Meeting! shortly subsequent): introducing
also a theory of their connexion with spherical trigonometry, some
sketch ofwhich appeared a few months later inLondon (in thePhi-
losophical MagazineforJuly, 1844). On that connexion ofquater-
nions with spherical trigonometry^ and generally with spherical
geometry^ I need not at present dwell, since it is sufficiently ex-
plained in the concluding Lectures ofthis Volume : but it may be
not improper that a brief account should here be given, of a not
much later but hitherto unpublished speculation, of a character
partly geometrical, but partly also metaphysical (or a priori), by
which I sought to explain and confirm some results that might
at first seem strange, among those to which myanalysis had con-
ducted me, respecting the quadrinomialform, and non-commuta-
tive property, of the product of two directed lines in space.
[50.] Let, then, the product of two co-initial lines, or of two
vectors from a commonorigin, be conceived to be something which
has QUANTITY, in the sense that it is doubled, tripled, &c., by dou-
bling, tripling, &c., either factor; let it also be conceived to have
in some sense, quality, analogous to direction, which is in some
waydefinitely connected with the directions of the two factor lines.
In particular let us conceive, in order to preserve so far an ana-
logy to algebraic multiplication, that its direction is in all re-
spects reversed, when either of those directions is reversed; and
therefore that it is restored, when both of them are reversed. On

the other hand, for the sake of recognising what may be called
the symmetry ofspace, let this direction ofthe product, so far as
it can be constructed or represented by that of any line in space,
be conceived as not changing its relation to the system ofthose
twofactordirections, when that system is in any mannerturnedin
space: its own direction, «« a line, being at the same time turned
with them, as if it formed a part ofone common and rigid system
and the numerical element of the same product (if it have any
such) undergoing no change by such rotation. Let the product
in question be conceived to be entirely determined, when the fac-
tors are determined; let it be made, if other conditions will allow,
for the sake of general analogies, a distributivefunction of those
two factors, summation of lines being performed by the same rules
as composition of motions; and finally, if these various conditions
can all be satisfied, and still leave anything undetermined, in the
rules for multiplication of lines, let the iiirleterminateness be re-
moved in such a way as to make these rules approach as much
as possible to the other usual rules for the multiplication of num-
bers in algebra.
[51.] The square ofa given line must not be any line in-
clined to that given line; for, even if we chose any particular
angle of inclination, there would be nothing to determine the
plane, and thus the square would be indeterminate, urdess we
selected some one direction in space as eminent, which selection
we are endeavouring to avoid. Nor can the square of a given
line be a line in the same direction, nor in the direction opposite;
for if ez7Aer of these directions were selected, by a definition, then
this definition would oblige us to consider the square as reversed
in direction, when the line of which it is the square is reversed;
whereas if the two factors of a product both change sign, the di-
rection of the product is always (by what has been above agreed
on) preserved, or rather restored. We must, therefore, consider
the SQUARE OF A LINE as having no direction in space, and there-
fore as being not (properly) itself a line ; but nothing hitherto
prevents us from regarding the square as a number, which has
always one determined sign (as yet unknown), and varies in the
duplicate ratio of the length of the line to be squared. If, then,
the length of a line a contain a times the unit of length, we arc

led to consider aa or a^ as a symbol equivalent to /a% in which I
is some numerical coefficient, positive or negative, as yet un-
known, but constant for all lines in space, or having one common
value for all. And, consequently, if a, /3 be any two lines in any
one common direction, and having their lengths denoted by the
numbers a and 6, we are led to regard the product a/3 as equal to
the number lab, I being the same coefficient as before. But if the
direction of/3 be exactly opposite to that of a, their lengths being
still a and b, their product is then equal to the opposite number,
—
lab. The same general conclusions might perhaps have been
more easily arrived at, if we had begun by considering the pro-
duct of two equally long but opposite lines; for it might perhaps
then have been even easier to see that, consistently with the sym-
metry ofspace, no one line rather than another could represent,
even in part, the direction of the product.
[52.] Next, let us consider the product aj3 of two mutually
perpendicular lines, a and j3, of which each has its length equal
to 1. Let a', j3' be lines respectively equal in length to these,
but respectively opposite in direction. Then a'j3 = - aj3= aj3'
a'/3'= a/3. If the sought product aj3 were equal to any number,
or even if it contained a number as a part ofits expression, then,
on our changing the multiplier a to its own opposite line a', this
product or part ought/or one reason(the symmetry ofspace) to re-
main constant (because the system of the factors would have been
merely turned in space); and for another reason (a'j3 =-a/3) the
same product or part ought to change sign (because one factor
would have been reversed): but this co-existence of opposite re-
sults would be absurd. We are led therefore to try whether the
present condition {oi rectangularity ofthe twofactors) allows us
to suppose the product a/3 to be a line.
[53.] Let y be a third line, of which the length is unity, and
which is at the positive side of /3, with reference to a as an axis
of rotation ; right-handed (or left-handed) rotation having been
previously selected as positive; let also y be the line opposite
to y. Then any line in space may be denoted by ma-V n^+py,
we are therefore to try whether we can consistently suppose a/3
= 7Wa + w/3 + p7, m, n, p being some three numerical constants.
If so, we should have (by the principle ofthe symmetry ofspace)
PREFACB. (51)
o'/3 = md+ w/3 +Pf'\ and therefore (by a change of all the signs)
a^=ma+nfi'+py] therefore nfi' =

finally n= 0. In like manner, since a/3 = -a/3' =- {ma+ w/3' +jo-y')
=»Ja'+n/3 +py, we should have ma = ma, and therefore m= 0.
But there is no objection of this kind against supposing a)3 =pyi
pbeing some numerical coefficient, constant for all pairs of rectan-
gular lines in space: for the reversal of the direction of a factor
has the effect of turning the system through two right angles
round the other factor as an axis, and so reverses the direction of
the product. And then if the lengths of these two lines a, /3, in-
stead ofbeing each= 1, are respectively a and b, their product a/3
will be =paby; that is, it will be a line perpendicular to both fac-
tors, with a length denoted by pab, and situated always to the
positive or always to the negative side ofthe multiplicand line /3,
with respect to the multiplierline a as an axis ofrotation, accord-
ing as the constant numberp is positive or negative.
[54.] So far, then, without having yet used any property of
multiplication, algebraical or geometrical, beyond the three prin-
ciples: 1st, that no one direction in space is to be regarded as
eminent above another; 2nd, that to multiply either/actor by any
number, positive or negative, multiplies the product by the same;
and 3rd, that the product oftwo determinedfactors is itselfde-
termined; we are led to assign interpretations: 1st, to the pro-
duct of two co-axal vectors, or of two lines parallel to each other,
or to one common axis; and 2nd, to the product of two rectan-
gular vecion; which interpretations introduce only two constant,
but as yet unknown, numerical coefficients, I and p, depending,
however, partly on the assumed unit of length. And we see
that for any two co-axal vectors, a, /3, the equation a/3- /3a=
holds good; but that for any two rectangular vectors, a/3 +/3a = 0.
hproduct oftwo rectangular lines is, therefore, so far as the
foregoing investigation leads us to conclude, not a commutative
function ofthem.
[pd."] Since then we are compelled, by considerations which
appear more primary, to give up the commutative property of
multiplication, as not holding generally for lines, let us at least
try (as was proposed) whether we can retain the distributive pro-
perty. If so, and if the multiplicand line /3 be the sum of two
(52) PREFACE.
Others, /3, and /3a, of which one (/3i) is co-axal with the n>ukiplier
line a, while the other (fii) is perpendicular thereto, we must in-
terpret the product aji as equal to the sum ofthe two partial
products, a/3i and aj^. But one of these is a nunaber, and the
other is a line ; we are, therefore, led to consider a numberas being
under these circumstances added to a line, and as forming with it
a certain suiriy or systeiUy denoted by aj3i +ajSz, or more shortly
by a[i^. And such a sum of line and number may perhaps be
called a grammarithm,* from the two Greek words, ypafifiru a
line, and apiOfiog, a number. Agrammarithm is thus to be con-
ceived as being entirely determined, whenits twoparts or elements
are so; that is, whenits ^ram;/2/c part is a known line,andits ari'M-
mic part is a known number. A change in either part is to be
conceived as changing the grammarithm: thus, an equation be-
tween two grammarithms includes generally two other equations,
one between two numbers, and another between two lines.
Adopting this view ofa grammarithm, and defining that aj3= a/3i
+ afhi when j3
=/3i + /Bz, j3i i a, jSz ± a, the product of any deter-
mined multiplier line and any determined multiplicand line will
be itself entirely determined, as soon as the unit of length and
the numbers / and p shall have been chosen ;. and it remains to
consider whether these numbers can now be so selected, as to
make the rules of multiplication of lines approach more closely
still to the rules of multiplication oinumbers.
{p^-'\ The general distributive principle will be found to give
no new condition; and we have seen cause to reject the commu-
tative principle or property, as not generally holding good in the
present inquiry. It remains, then, to try whether we can deter-
mine or connect the two coefficients, / and jt?, so as to satisfy the
associative principle, or to verify the formula,

• The word "grammarithm" was subsequently proposed in a communication
to the Royal Irish Academy (see the Proceedings of July, 1846), as one which
?niyht replace the word"
quaternion," at least in the geometrical view of the
subject: but it did not appear that there would be anything gained by the sys-
tematic adoption of this change of expression, although the mere suygestion of
another name, as not inapplicable, seemed to throw a little additional light on
tiie whole theory.
PREFACE. (53)
For this purpose we may first distribute the factors j3, 7 into
others, ^i^tyiyzy^ which shall be parallel or perpendicular to
it and to each other; and then shall have to satisfy, if possible,
six conditions, which may be reduced to the six following
a' aa—aa. a\ a» aa = aa . a ; a. aa = aa> a" ',
a. aa = aa- a', a. a'a = aa. a ; a. a'a" = aa. u"
;
a, a', a" being three rectangular unit-lines, so placed that the ro-
tation round a from a to a" is positive. Then, by what has been
already found, the following relations will hold good
aa =a'a' = aa"= I ; aa =—a'a=pa"',
aa' =—a'a =—pa; olcl' =- a'a = +p)a ;
and the six conditions to be satisfied become,
a. 1=1. a; a.pa"= I. a'; a .-pa'= 1 . a',
a . -pa =pa. a\ a. 1 = pa" .a"; a. pa=pa". a".
Ofthese the first suggests to us to treat an arithmic factor as
commutative (as regards order) with a grammic one, or to treat
the product"
line into number" as equivalent to
" number into
line;" the fourth and sixth conditions aflFord no new information;
and the second, third, and fifth become,
-p^a= la ;
-p"^ a = la ; -p^ a = la.
The conditions ofassociation are therefore all satisfied by our
assuming, with the present signification of the symbols,
al=la, and l=-p^;
and they cannot be satisfied otherwise. The constant I is, there-
fore, by those conditions, necessarily negative; and every line
in tridimensional space has its square (on this plan) equal to a
NEGATIVE number: which is one of the most novel but essential
elements of the whole quaternion theory. (Compare the recent
paragraph [48]; also art. 85, pages 81, 82, of the Lectures.) And
that a grammarithm [55] may properly be called a quaternion,
appears from the consideration that the /me, which in it is added
to a number, depends itself upon a system ofthree numbers, or
may be represented by a trinomial expression, because it is al-
ways the sum ofthree lines (actual or null), which are parallel

to three fixed directions (compare Lecture III.). The coefficient
p remains still undetermined, and may be made equal to positive
one, by a suitable choice of the unit of length, and the direction
of positive rotation. In this way we shall have finally the very
simple values,
/> = + 1, /=-l;
and the rules for the multiplication oflines in space will then be-
come entirely definite^ and will agree in all respects with the re-
lations [48], between the symbols ijk.
[57.] Another train of a priori reasoning, by which I early
sought to confirm, or (if it had been necessary) to correct, the
results expressed by those new symbols, was stated to the R. I.
Academy* in (substantially) the following way. Admitting,for di-
rected and co;?/anar lines, the conception [36] oiproportion; and
retaining the symbols ijk, or more fully, + 1, +j, + A, to denote
three rectangular unit-lines as above, while the three respectively
opposite lines may be denoted by-
1, -j, -k; but not assuming
the knowledge of any laws respecting their multiplication^ I
sought to determine what ought to he considered as the fourth
PROPORTIONAL, M, to the three rectangular directions]j, t, A,
consistently with that knownconception [362/ordirections within
the plane, and with some general and guiding principles, respect-
ing ratios and proportions. These latter assumed principles
(of a regulative rather than a constitutive kind) were simply
the following: 1st, that ratios similar to the same ratio must
be regarded as similar to each other; 2nd, that the respec-
tively inverse ratios are also mutually similar; and 3rd, that
ratios are similar, if they be similarly compounded of similar
ratios: this similarity of composition being understood to include
generally a sameness of order. It seemed to me that any pro-
posed definitional^ use of the word ratio, which should be in-

I In the abstract published in the Proceedings, the words" South, West,
Up" were used at first instead ofthe symbols i,j, h ; and the sought fourth pro-
portional tojik, which is here denoted byu, was called, provisionally," Forward."
X As an example of the use of the first of these very simple principles, in
serving to exclude a definition which might for a moment appear plausible, let us
take the construction [38], and inquire whether (as that construction would

consistent with these principles, would depart thereby too widely
from known analogies^ mathematical andmetaphysical, and would
involvean improprietyoflanguage: while,on the other hand,it ap-
peared that if these principles were attended to, andother analogies
observed,itwaspermitted to extend the use ofthat wordra^to, and
suggest) we canproperly say that/our directions (or four diverging unit-lines),
a, /3, y, S, form generally a proportion in space, when the angles aS, /3y, between
the extremes and means have one common bisector (j). If so, when the three di-
rections a, ji, y became rectangular, we should have a: /3: : y:
—
a, and y:
—a
:: p-.-y, but we should have also, a: /3: : /3:
- a, and not a: j3 :: p:
-
y; so that
the two ratios, a: /3 and j3:-
y, would be said to be similar to one common ratio
(y:
-a), without being similar to each other, if the foregoing constructionfor a
fourth proportional were to be, by definition, adopted: and this objection alone
would be held by me to be decisive against the introduction of such a definition ;
and therefore also against the adoption ofthe connected rule mentioned in [38],
as having at one time occurred to a friend (J. T. G.) and to.myself, for the mul-
tiplication of lines in space, even if there were no other reasons (as in fact there
are), for the rejection ofthatrule. Asimilar objection applies, withequal decisive-
ness, against the rule mentioned in [37], as an earlier conjecture ofmyown. On
theother hand,an analogous and equally simple argumentmay serve tojustify the
notation d—c=b—a, employed by me in the followingLectures, andelsewhere,to
express that the two right lines ab and CD are equally long and similarly directed,
against an objection made some years ago, in a perfectly candid spirit, by an
able writer in the Philosophical Magazine (for June, 1849, p. 410); who thought
that interpretation more arbitrary than it had appeared to me to be; and
suggested that the same notation might as well have been employed to signify
this other conception:—that the two equally long lines ab, cd met somewhere, at
a finite or infinite distance. I could not admit this extension ; for it would lead
to the conclusion that two lines ab, ef might be equal to the same third line cd,
without being equal to each other : which would (in my opinion) be so great a
violation of analogy, as to render the use of the word "equal," or ofthe sign =,
with the interpretation referred to, an embarrassment instead of an assistance.
But I do not feel that analogies are thus violated, by the simultaneous admis-
sion of the two contrastedproportions (see (3) (4) (5) of [57] ),
u:i.:j:k, u:j:: ii- k;
for the elementary theorem called often '• alternando," (ivaWd^ Xoyof, Euc. V.
Def.13, and Prop. 16) is byits nature limited (in its original meaning) to the case
where the meows which change places are homogeneous with each other ; whereas
two rectangular directions, as here i andj, are in this whole theory regarded as
being in some sense heterogeneous. They have at least no relation to each other,
which can be represented by any ratio, such as Euclid considers, of magnitude
to magnitude; and therefore we have no right to expect, from analogy to old re-
sults, that alternation shall generally be allowed in a, proportion involving such
directions : although, within the plane, alternation isfound to be admissible.

• Since the note to paragraph [36], pp. (31) (32), was in type, I have had an
opportunityof re-consulting the fourth volume ofthe Annates de Mathematiques,
and have found myrecollections (agreeing indeed in the main with the formerly
cited page 228 of Dr. Peacock's admirable Report), respecting the admitted
priority of Argand, confirmed. Franyais, indeed (in 1813), published in those
Annales (Tome IV., pp. 61,. . 71) a paper which contained a theory of "pro-
portion de grandeur et de position," with a connected theory of multiplication
(and also of addition) of lines in a given plane; but he expressly and honourably
stated at the same time (p. 70), that he owed the substance of those new ideas
to another person ("le fond de ces ideas nouvelles ne ra' appartient pas"):
and on being soon afterwards shewn, through Gergonne, whose conduct in the
whole matterdeserves praise, a copyofArgand's earlier andprinted Essay (Paris,
1806), Franyais mostfully and distinctly recognised(p. 225)that the true author of
the method was Argand ("il n'y a pas le moindre doute qu'on ne doive ii M. Ar-
gand la premiere idee de rcpresenter g^ometriqueraent les quantites imagi-
naires"). Nothing more lucid than Argand's own statements (see the same
volume, pp. 136, 137, 138), as regards thefundamentalprinciples of the theory of
the addition and multiplication of coplanar lines, has since (so far as I know)
appeared; not even in the writings of Professor De Morgan on Double Algebra,
referred to in former notes. But Argand had not anticipated De Morgan's
theory of Logometers; and was on the contrary disposed (pp. 144,.. 146) to
_V~1
regard the symbol V— 1
, notwithstanding Euler's well-known result, as de-
noting a /('we (kp), perpendicular to the plane of the lines 1 and V— 1: and to con-
sider it as offering an example of a quantity which was irreducible to theform
p-\- q V- 1, and was (according to him) as heterogeneous with respect to V— 1, as
the latter with respect to + 1 (" aussi hetcrogene" &c ). The word modulus
(" modulo"), so well known by the important writings of M. Cauchy, occurs in a
later paper by Argand, in the following volume of the Annales, as denoting
the real quantity ^/p'^ + q'. If I have seemed to dwell too much on the specula-
tions of Argand (not all adopted by myself), it has been partly because (so far
as I have observed) his merits as an original inventor have not yet been suffi-
ciently recognised by mathematicians in these countries: and partly because one
ofthe two most essential linhs {the other hti'ing addition) between Double Algebra
and Quaternions, is Argand's ma,maiX\dfundamentalprinciple respecting copla-
nar PROPORTION, expressed by him as follows (Annales, T. IV., pp. 136, 137):

to Fran9ais, after the appearance of the first paper of the latter author on the
subject in 1813). Argand continued thus (in p. 137):

but also, in the planes of y, ik, there were the two proportions,
i :j ::j:-i, and k:i :: -i:k; (3)
compounding therefore, on the one hand, the two ratios, u: k and
k : I, and, on the other hand, the two respectively similar ratios,
j: -if and -e: A, there resulted the new proportion,
u:i::j:k; (4)
which differed from the proportion (2) only by a cyclical trans-
• Although the observations in par. [37] relate rather to proportions than to
imaginaries, yet the present may be a convenient occasion for remarking that
Bu6e, and even Wallis, had speculated, before Argand and Fran9ais, on inter-
pretations ofthe symbol V— 1, which should extend to space: but that the nearest
approach to an anticipation oj^ the quaternions, or at least to an anticipation of
triplets, seems to me to have been made by Servois, in a passage of the lately
cited volume of Gergonne's Annales, which appears curious and appropriate
enough to be extracted here. Servois hadbeen following up a hint ofGergonne,
respecting the representation of ordinary imaginaries of the form x+y'^-l
(* and y being whole numbers), by a table of double argument (p. 71); and
thought (p. 235) that such a table mightbe regarded as only a slice (une tranche)
of a table of trifle argument, for representing points {or lines) in space. He

thus continued:

position of the three directions ijk. For the same reason, we
may make another cyclical change of the same sort, and may
write
u:j:: k:i; (5)
while, in this cycle of three rectangular directions, ijk, the right-
handed (or left-handed) character of the rotation, round the first
from the second to the third, is easily seen to be unaffected by
such a transposition. Again compounding the two similar ratios
(1) with these two others, which are evidently similar, whatever
the unknown direction u may be,
i: -i :: u:-u, (6)
we find this other proportion,
j:-i::k:-u', (7)
and therefore, by (2) and (3),
u:h:: k:-u. (8)
In like manner,
u:i :: i:- Ui and u:j ::j:-u; (9)
and in any one of these proportions, any two terras, whether be-
longing to the same or to different ratios, may have their signs
changed together. All these proportions, (2). . (9), follow from
the original supposition (1), by the general principles above
stated, without the direction u being as yet any otherwise deter-
mined.
[58.] Suppose now that the two rectangular directionsj and
k are made to turn together^ in their own plane, round i as an
axis, till they take two new positions^i and k^ which will there-
fore satisfy the proportion,
j:k::j\:k,. (10)

where /, m, n may represent any three rectangular directions
whatever, subject only to the condition that the rotation round

j to k. With this condition, therefore, the first assumed propor-
tion ( I ) may be replaced by this more general one
n'.m::l:u', (14)
while for (8) and (9) may now be written, with the same signi-
fication of the symbols,
u:l::l:-u\ u:m::m:-U', u:n::n:-u; (15)
and because n: m :: m:-n,we have these other and not less ge-
neral proportions,
mi-n :: l:u\ m:n :: l:-u. (16)
If, then, there be any such fourth proportional, m, as has been
above supposed, to the three given rectangular directions^, i, yfc,
the same direction u, or the opposite direction-
u, will also be,
in the same sense, the fourth proportional to any other three rect-
angular directions, n, w, /, or w, n, I, according as the character
of a certain rotation is preserved or reversed.
[59.] This remarkable result appeared to me to justify the
regarding the directions here called + u and-u rather as nume-
rical (or algebraical) than as linear (or geometrical) units; and
to make it proper to denote them simply by the symbols +
and -1; because their directions were seen to admit only ofa
certain contrast between themselves, but not of any other change:
all that geometrical variety, which results from the conception of
tridimensional space, having been found to disappear, as regarded
them, in an investigation conducted as above. And in fact it is
not permitted, on the foregoing principles, to identify the direc-
tion u with that oi any line (/) whatever: for in that case the
proportion (13) would give the result I: I :: m:n, which must be
regarded in this theory as an absurd one, the two terms of one
ratio being coincident directions, while those of the other ratio
are rectangular. But there is no objection of this sort against
our supposing, as above, that
+ M = 4 1, -«=- 1; and then the proportions, derived from (13), (15),

were shewn (in 1844) to be consistent with a priori principles, and
with considerations of a general nature ; a product being here
regarded as a fourth proportional, to a certain extra-spatial*
unitf and to two directed factor-lines in space: whereas, in the
investigation of paragraphs [50] to [pQ^, it was viewed rather as
a certain function ofthose two factors, theform ofwhich func-
tion was to be determined in the manner most consistent with
some general and guiding analogies, and with the conception of
the symmetry ofspace. But there was still another view of the
whole subject, sketched not long afterwards in another commu-
nication to the R. I. Academy,t on which it is unnecessary to say
more than a few words in this place, because it is, in substance,
the view adopted in the following Lectures, and developed with
some fulness in them : namely, that view according to which a
Quaternion is considered as the Quotient of two directed lines
in tridimensional space.
• It seemed (and still seems) to me natural to connect this extra-spatial unit
with the conception [3] of time, regarded here merely as an axis of continuous
and uni-dimcnsional progression. But whether we thus considerjointly time and
space, or conceive generally any system offour independent axes, or scales of pro-
gression (m, i,j, k), I am disposed to infer from the above investigation the fol-
lowing LAW OF THE FOUR SCALES, as One which is at least consistent with
analogy, and admissible as a definitional extension of the fundamental equations
—
of quaternions:
" A formula oiproportion between four independent and directed
units is to be considered as remaining true, when any two of them change places
with each other (in the formula), provided that the direction (or sign) of one be
reversed." Whatever may be thought of these abstract and semi-metaphysical
views, theformula (a) (b) (c) of par. [GO] are in any event a sufficient basis for
the erection of a calculds of quaternions.

[61.] Ofsuch a geometrical quotienty* b -§. a, the fundamen-
tal property is in this theory conceived to be, that by operating^
as a multiplier (or at least in a way analogous to multiplication),
on the divisor-line^ a, \i produces (or generates) the dividend-
line, b; and that thus it may be interpreted as satisfying the
general and identical formula (compare [9] )
(b -^*a) X a =b.
The analogy to multiplication consists partly in the operation
being one which is performed at once on length and on direction,
as in the ordinary multiplication of a line by a positive or nega-
tive number; or as is done in that known generalization [36] of
such multiplication, for lines within one plane, which (for reasons
assigned in notes to former paragraphs) ought (I think) to be
called the Method of Argand: and partly in the circumstance
that the new operation possesses, like that older one (from which,
however, it is entirely distinct,^ in many other and important re-
spects), the distributive and associative^X though not like it (ge-
nerally) the commutative properties, of what is called multipli-
• This view of a geometrical quotient was also developed to a certain extent,
in an unfinished series of papers, which appeared a few years ago in the Cam-
bridge and Dublin Mathematical Journal, under the head of Symbolical Geome-
try: a title adopted to mark that I had attempted, in the composition of that
particular series, to allow a more prominent influence to the general laws of
symbolical language than in some former papers of mine ; and that to this extent
I had on that occasion sought to imitate the Symbolical Algebra of Dr. Peacock,
and to profit also by some of the remarks of Gregory and Ohm.
f Among these distinctions of method, it is important to bear in mind that no
one line is taken, in my system, as representing the direction ofpositive unity: and
that, on the contrary, every vector-unit is regarded as one ofthe square roots of
negative unity. It is to be remarked, also, that the product of two inclined but
non-rectangular vectors is considered in this theory as not a line, but a quater-
nion: all which will be found fully illustrated in the Lectures.
i To this associative principle, or property of multiplication, I attach much
importance, andhave taken pains to shew, in the Fifth and Sixth Lectures, that
it can be geometrically proved for quaternions, independently of the distributive
principle, which may, however, in a different arrangement of the subject, bo
made to precede and assist the proof of the associative property, as shewn in th«
Seventh Lecture, and elsewhere. The absence of the associative principle ap-
pears to me to be an inconvenience in the octaves or octonomials of Messrs. J. T.
Graves and Arthur Cayley (see Appendix B, p. 730): thus in the notation of the
former we should indeed have, as in quaternions, ij=k, but not generally i.ju

cation in algebra;* at least when a few definitional formulae
(resembling those in par. [9] ) are established. And the motive
(in this view) for calling such a quotient a Quaternion, or the
ground for connecting its conception with the number Four, is
derived from the consideration that while the relative length
of the two lines compared depends only on one number^ express-
ing their ratio (of the ordinary kind), their relative direc-
tion depends on a system ofthree numbers : one denoting the
angle (a^
b) between the two lines, and the two others serving
to determine the aspect of the plane of that angle, or the direc-
tion of the AXIS of the positive rotation in that plane,/row the
divisor-line (a) to the dividend-line (b).

these Lectures, as denoting merely that usual species of algebra, in which the
equation ab =ba is treated as universally true, and not (of course) as implying
any degree of disrespect to those many and eminent writers, who have not hi-
therto chosen to admit into their calculations such equations as a/3 =-/3a, for
the multiplication of two rectangular lines, or for other and more abstract pur-
poses. It is proper to state here, that a species of non-commutative multiplication
for inclined lines (aussere Multiplikation) occurs in a very original and remark-
able work by Prof. H. Grassmann (Ausdehnungslehre, Leipzig, 1844), which I
did not meet with till after years had elapsed from the invention and communi-
cation of the quaternions: in which work I have also noticed (when too late to
acknowledge it elsewhere) an employment of the symbol^ -a, to denote the
directed line (Strecke), drawn from the point a to the point /3. Nothwithstand-
ing these, and perhaps some other coincidences ofview. Prof. Grassmann's system
and mine appear to be perfectly distinct and independent of each other, in their
conceptions, methods, and results. At least, that the profound and philosophi-
cal author of the Ausdehnungslehre was not, at the time of its publication, in
possession of the theory of the quaternions, which had in the preceding year
(1843) been applied by me as a sort of organ or calculusfor spherical trigonome-
try, seems clear from a passage of his Preface (Vorrede, p. xiv.), in which he
states (under date of June 28th, 1844), that he had not then succeeded in ex-
tending the use of imaginariesfrom the plane to space; and generally that unsur-
mounted difficulties had opposed themselves to his attempts to construct, on his
principles, a theory of angles in space (hingegen ist es nicht mehr moglich, ver-
mittclst des Imaginaren auch die Gesetze fiir den Raum abzuleiten. Auch
stellen sich iiberhaupt der Betrachtung dcr Winkel im Raume Schwierigkeiten
entgegen, zu deren allseitiger Losung rair noch nicht hinreichende Musse gewor-
den ist). The earlier treatise by Prof. A. F. Miibius (der barycentrische Calcul,
Leipzig, 1827), referred to in the same Preface by Grassmann, appears to be
a work which likewise well deserves attention, for its conceptions, notations,
and results ; as does also another work of Mobius (Mechanik des Himmels,
Leipzig, 1843), elsewhere referred to in these Lectures (page 614).
PREFACE. (63)
[62.] For the unfolding of this general view,* and the deduc-
tion from it of many geometricalf and of some physical^ conse-
quences, I must refer to the following Lectures ; of which a
considerable part has been drawn up in a more popular§ style than
this Preface: while the whole has been composed under the in-
fluence of a sincere desire to render the exposition ofthe subject
as clear and elementary as possible. The prefixed Table of
Contents (pp. ix. to Ixxii.), though somewhat fuller than usual,
will be found useful (it is hoped) not merely as an analytical
Index, assisting a reader to refer easily to any part ofthe volume
which he has once carefully read, but also as a general abridg-
ment of the work, and in some places as a commentary.^ The
• I mayjust hint here that the biqdaternionb of Lcct. VII. admit of being
geometrically interpreted (comp. note to [19] ), by considering each as a couple of
quotients (-, -), constructed by a tribadiajl (a, /3, y), and multiplied by a com-
mutative factor of the form V-1 (compare [16] ), when the line-couple (/3, y) is
changed to (- y, /3), or when the angle (3y is changed to an adjacent angle.
f Notwithstanding some references to works of M. Chasles, and other emi-
nent foreign geometers, myacquaintance with their writings is far too imperfect
to give me any confidence in the novelty of various theorems in the VII"' Lec-
ture and Appendix (such as those respecting generations of the ellipsoid, and
inscriptions of gauche polygons in surfaces of the second order), beyond what
is derived from the opinion ofa few geometrical friends.
X Some such physical applications were early suggested by Sir J. Herschel.
§ It had been designed that these Lectures should not go much more into
detail than those which have been actually delivered on the subject by me, in
successive years, in the Halls of this University; and the First Lecture, printed
in 1848 (as the astronomical allusions at its commencement may indicate), wag
in fact delivered in that year, in very nearly the form in which it now appears.
But it was soon found necessary to extend the plan ofthe composition:
and it is
evident that the subsequent Lectures, as printed, are too long, and that the last
of them involves too much calculation, to have been delivered in their present
form: though something ofthe style of actual lecturing has been here and there
Fetained. The real divisions of the work are not so much the Lectures them-
selves, as the shorter and more numerous Articles, to which accordingly the
references have been chiefly made. An intermediate form of subdivision into
Sections has however been used in drawing up the Contents, which the reader
may adopt or not at his discretion, marking or leaving unmarked the margin of
the Lectures accordingly. Some new terms and symbols have been unavoidably
introduced into the work, but it is hoped that they will not be found embarrass-
ing, or difficult to remember and apply.

Diagramsare numerous, and have been engraved* with care from
my drawings: some of them may perhaps be thought to have
been unnecessary, but it appeared better to err, if at all, on the
side ofclearness and fulness of illustration, especially in the early
parts of a work based on a new mathematical conception, and
designed to furnish, to those who may be disposed to employ it,
a new mathematical organ. Whatever may be thought of the
degree of success with which my exertions in this matter have
been attended, it will be felt, at least, that they must have been
arduous and persevering. My thanks are due, at this last stage,
to the friends who have cheered me throughout by their conti-
nued sympathy; to the scientific contemporaries! who have at
moments turned aside from their own original researches, to no-
tice, and in some instances to extend, results or speculations of
mine; to my academical superiors who have sanctioned, as a
subject of public and repeated examination in this University,
the theory to which this Volume relates, and have contributed to
lighten, to an important extent, the pecuniary risk of its publi-
cation: but, above all, to that Great Being, who has graciously
spared to me such a measure of health and energy as was required
for bringing to a close this long and laborious undertaking.

\ In these countries, Messrs. Boole, Carmichael, Cayley, Cockle, De Morgan,
Donkin, Charles andJohn Graves, Kirkman, O'Brien, Spottiswoode, Young, and
perhaps others: some of whose researches or remarks on subjects connected with
quaternions (such as the triplets, tessarines, octaves, and pluquaternions) have
been elsewhere alluded to, butof which I much regret the impossibility of giving
here a fuller account. As regards the theory of algebraic keys (clefs algebriques),
lately proposed by one of the most eminent of continental analysts, as one that
includes the quaternions (Comptes Rendus for Jan. 10, 1853, p. 73), it appears to
me to be virtually included in that theory of sets in algebra (explained in the
present Preface), which was announced by me in 1835, and published in 1848
(Trans. R.I. A., Vol. XXL, Partii., p. 229, &c., the symbols x, being in fact
what M.Cauchy calls keys), as an extension ofthe theoryofcoup/es (and therefore
also of imaginaries): ofwhich sets I have always considered the qdateknions
(in their symbolical aspect) to be merely aparticular case. Before the publica-
tion of those sets, the closely connected conception of an "algebra ofthe n"" cha-
racter" had occurred to Prof. De Morgan in 1844, avowedly aa a suggestion from
the quaternions. (Trans. Camb. Phil. Soc, Vol. VIII., Part lu.)
